Here are my favorite books!

## Nonfiction

### Pirates by Will Osborne and Mary Pope Osborne

The kid's book that started my obsession with pirates.

### Beneath the Seven Seas by George F. Bass

A big book about marine archaeology. The topic itself is interesting to me but I didn't appreciate much of the text when I was younger and only looked at the photos. Looking to reread this one.

### [[The Defining Decade by Meg Jay]]

A book on how to navigate the confusing world as a twentysomething person. 

## Fiction

### Rose of Versailles by Riyoko Ikeda
A historical-fiction manga about Marie Antoinette.

### What's Michael? by Makoto Kobayashi
A funny and somewhat absurd book about cats.
