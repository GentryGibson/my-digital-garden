1. Go to Goodreads [Import/Export page](https://www.goodreads.com/review/import).
2. Import the .CSV file and wait for import results
3. Go to My Books to review the newly imported books on the Read shelf
- **Note:** If books don't show up, manually add them to the database
	- If book is a manga, look for its original language version and add that instead if it doesn't import successfully.
