## Do You Have to Know the Syntax of a Programming Language?
---

-   100% yes but you don't need encyclopedic knowledge for this
    -   Take your knowledge of the tool to produce the desired outcome
        -   Build an app from scratch, add something to an existing app, able to resolve bugs, fix issues
-   **Key thing:** Understand how to use logic to write computer code to produce a desired outcome
    -   Example: You may know HTML, CSS, and Javascript but if you don't know how to put those knowledge to create a to-do list then it's all for nothing
        -   Knowledge of those programs alone does not guarantee that you are able to build stuff from scratch
-   Understand how to use the programming language to write rules for your computer to follow so that it will produce the desired outcome
-   Improve logic by focusing on building projects
