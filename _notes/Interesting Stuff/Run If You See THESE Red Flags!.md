## How Do You Know If a Lead is Not Qualified?

### Four Red Flags
1. Not really sure of their goal or needs
2.  Will not tell you a budget or respond to a range
3.   Has no timeline for the project
4.   Asks for a proposal too soon
- If you see one or more of these, get out asap! 
	- This is a sign of someone not serious with working with you

## What Can We Send a Lead that Is Not Qualified?

### Provide a Capabilities Deck
1. Who you are as a company
2. What you do
3. What you've done for other people (case studies)
4. Basic price range sheet
