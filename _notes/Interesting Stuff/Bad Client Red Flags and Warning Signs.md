## Notes from tsdcusa's comment

- **First Red Flag:** When a client doesn't have a budget or says they don't have a lot of money
	- What this means: They don't know the value of the work they want or they're just playing you
- **Second Red Flag:** Not reading the proposal and feeling like getting ripped off.
	- What this means: Client is not looking at the overall value that you are bringing to his business = he won't value you and your experience.
- **Third Red Flag:** Not having a budget if you ask for one
	- What this means: They are not taking you seriously. See [[Run If You See THESE Red Flags!]]
- **Fourth Red Flag:** Clients thinking that they are doing you a favor, believing that they own you, and push things past the scope of the project
- **Fifth Red Flag:** Not respecting your time. You end up as their 24/7 person ready to take in calls at the most inappropriate times.
