These are notes that I took from Traversy Media's video on becoming a self-taught software developer.

## 1. Figure Out Your End Goal
---


-   Work for a big company, startup, freelance?
-   Web development (frontend/backend), gaming, data science, mobile apps
    -   There are many different paths in programming and technology
-   What are you naturally good at?
    -   **Try to look at what you're naturally good at**
        -   **Math** = Data science or low-level programming
        -   **Visual** = Web development, mobile development, or desktop applications
-   Check pay scales, job security, etc for different types of dev jobs

## 2. Choose a Programming Language
---


-   Figure out which language you should learn for what you want to do
    -   **Python** = Data science, machine learning, and AI
    -   **Swift or Java** = Mobile development
    -   **C++** = Game development
    -   **HTML and CSS** = Web development
        -   Not exactly a programming language but like building blocks
            -   Then you move to **Javascript, PHP, or Python** or any server-side development
-   Fundamentals first! (Save frameworks, etc for later)
    -   Learn computer science fundamentals and principles
-   Choose a text editor / IDE and get comfortable with it
    -   Use Visual Studio code for everything but for web dev like Java you need some kind of IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
-   You can always switch or learn another language

## 3. Find Resources & Build a Curriculum
---


-   **Books:** Great for learning language fundamentals
    -   Good for fundamentals, history, and programming languages
    -   Bad for frameworks and libraries as those get updated often
-   **Documentation:** Best used for reference
    -   Best resource for technology but more for reference
    -   Supplement to a more linear course
-   **Resource Websites:** W3Schools, MDN Web Docs
    -   Great sites for beginners
-   **Video Courses:** YouTube, Udemy, Pluralsight, Lynda, Coursera, etc
    -   Like books, these are great for fundamentals and programming languages as those don't get updated often
-   **Online Bootcamp:** Freecodecamp, Codeacademy, Team Treehouse
    -   Laid out courses. Good if you don't know how to make your own curriculum
-   **Challenge Websites:** Codewars

## 4. Find a Community
---

-   Having people to talk to and learn from is very beneficial
-   Find a mentor if possible
-   Join an online community
-   Go to meetups

## 5. Create Your Own Projects
---

-   Following along with courses is only half the battle
-   This is where most get stuck and many quit
-   Your projects do NOT have to be from scratch
    -   Take something from the courses and build something new out of it
-   Add new features, use the docs as a supplement to figure new stuff out
-   Look at other people's code that is similar to what you want to achieve
-   Eventually you won't need to use other projects as starting point

## 6. Create Your Portfolio
---

-   Create an attractive but simple portfolio
-   Showcase a live version (if possible) and your source code
-   Self taught developers NEED a great portfolio with work examples

## 7. Contribute to Open Source
---

-   Gives you experience with real-life projects
-   Collaborate with other developers
-   Something for your resume
-   Learn how to use Github
