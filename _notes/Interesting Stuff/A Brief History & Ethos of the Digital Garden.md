## üñäÔ∏è Literature Notes
---
- Digital gardens do not follow the same conventions seen on personal blogs.
	- Instead of posts displayed in a chronological order, digital gardens are like work-in-progress wikis.
	- Notes are half-finished thoughts that grow over time.
		- Less rigid and less perfect compared to personal websites.
- Digital gardens are similar to the sites from the Old Web. 
	- Think of the Geocities or Angelfire websites that have the "Under Construction üöß" sections and pages.
- It is not a Wordpress plugin, Gastby theme, or Jekyll template.
	- Instead, it is a different way of think about our behavior when it comes to information.
- **Argument:** We get swept away by constant streams of information: the notifications on your email, the newsfeed on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram, backlog of media, etc.
	- These have a time and place but are not designed to get knowledge and connect information.
- **Counterbalance:** Digital gardens present information in a linked space that grows over time.
	- Notes in these gardens are connected to each other allowing you to jump from one note to another. (Similar to the links in Wikipedia.)
	- Gardens help us move away from time-sink activities and into knowledge spaces.
- The digital garden process involves writing, rewriting, and editing your notes over time.
	- In contrast to regular blog posts wherein you post fully formed opinions on something and then never changing them again.
- The **"Chronological Sort Era"** probably killed the old quirky websites and standardized how blogs should look like.
	- Which may have led to standardized layouts in social media sites.
	- Digital gardens are a pushback against this norm. 


### The Six Patterns of Gardening
1. **Topography over Timelines**
	- Blogs use timelines to display their content in a reverse chronological order
	- Gardens are organized based on similar theme or topic through bi-directional links.
		- Examples: All my notes about drawing fundamentals are under the an index note that gathers all drawing related topics.
		- Gardens offer a number of entry points when browsing its contents.
2. **Continuous Growth**
	- Gardens are never finished but constantly grows over time.
		- They are designed to evolve alongside your thoughts. This also allows you to think critically on the information you consume and forces you to consider similarities, counter-arguments, and trends.
	- Tending your "seedlings" frees you from the pressure to get everything right immediately. This allows you to test ideas, get feedback, and revise your opinions.
	- Tending your garden is a "low-friction" activity. Small changes to your notes allow big things to grow.
	- A garden helps readers gain insight into your writing and thinking process. It may also inspire them to create a digital garden of their own.
		- This also helps them realize that you are not a magical content farm that sends out perfectly thought posts every week.
3. **Learning in Public & Imperfection**
	- Gardens are imperfect by design but this enables you to learn in public.
		- Learn in public = sharing what you learn as you're learning it.
	- Learning in public may seem strange at first as we are expected to build our own personal brand (with ‚Ñ¢ for show) and market your optimized content.
	- In response to professional personal blogs, digital gardens are weird and quirky just like the old websites from the early 2000s.
4. **Playful, Personal, and Experimental**
	- Gardens are a personal playspace. It is up to you on how you organize your ideas.
		- They also invite people to experiment with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to produce different web designs.
		- They offer the ability to present ourselves in forms that are not cookie cutter profiles (i.e. filling forms on the Facebook profile or the bio part in Twitter.)
5. **Intercropping & Content Diversity**
	- All forms of media grow in the garden.
		- You can add your notes on a specific video, podcast, article, academic journals, or illustrations.
6. **Independent Ownership**
	- You fully own and control your garden.
		- They do not live on the big name social media's servers.
	- All your content stored in the garden uses Markdown file format which is compatible in most operating systems.
