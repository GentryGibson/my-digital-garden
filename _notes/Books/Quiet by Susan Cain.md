## üìî Book Report
---
### üöÄ Summary
This is a book about introverts, their main characteristics, struggles, and how they are different from extroverts. This is also not an "anti-extrovert" book.

### üé® Impressions
My first thought upon seeing this book is "finally there's a book about the thing that I was described as". A lot of self-help books focus on being charismatic or improving your personality and this one felt like a breath of fresh air when it was first released.

### ‚òò How the Book Changed Me
This book gave me the feeling that "I am not alone at experiencing this.".


### ‚úçÔ∏è My Top 3 Quotes
- We don't need giant personalities to transform companies. We need leaders who build not their own egos but the institutions they run.
- Don't mistake assertiveness or eloquence for good ideas.
- True self-esteem comes from competence, not the other way around.



## üñäÔ∏è Literature Notes
---


### On Individuality
- We like [[Double standards of individuality|individuality]] but not the kind that makes us look like loners or "anti-socials". Instead, society prefers the type that "puts oneself out there".
	- Because of this, introversion (along with shyness, seriousness, and sensitivity) has been sometimes seen as a pathology or things that you have to overcome or fix.

### Culture of Character vs. Culture of Personality
- [[Culture of Character values inner virtue|Culture of Character]] = What's important are the good deeds that you do when no one is looking.
	- The 1899 pamphlet called Character: The Grandest Thing in the World teaches that.
- [[Culture of Personality values outer charm|Culture of Personality]] = All about charisma and being magnetic. Focusing on how others perceived them.
	- [[The shift to industrialization requires people to have charisma|The rise of big businesses]] means that more and more people need to prove themselves and so, having charisma was needed to compete
		- Around this time, a guy named Dale Carnegie released How to Win Friends and Influence People as a guide for that. Compare the two books and notice how the other one is still remains a bestseller to this day.
		- [[Movie stars and celebrities exemplify the Culture of Personality|The rise of movie stars and celebrities]] may have contributed to this phenomena. These people are the embodiment of the Culture of Personality and the common people look up to them for inspiration.
- We need leaders who build the institutions that they run. No need for giant personalities and egos to do that.

### Extroverts vs. Introverts
- Extroverted leaders tend to put their own stamp on things and be dominant. This leads to the underlings to not share their good ideas and also allows passivity.
- Introverted leaders allow their underlings to do their thing. This delivers better outcomes only if the underlings are proactive.
- Introverts prefer to work independently and in [[Solitude allows you to activate Deliberate Practice mode|solitude.]]
- When you're alone, you can do things in Deliberate Practice mode. This "mode" allows you to focus and is the key to exceptional achievement.
	- Teenagers dread being alone and because of this, they fail to cultivate their talents.
	- Things such as practicing music or studying requires solitude.

### Corporate Myths
- [[Open-offices reduce productivity|Open-plan offices are bad]]. They reduce productivity and impair memory and is associated with high staff turnover.
- [[Interruption kills focus and productivity|Being interrupted]] is the biggest barrier of productivity.
- [[Multitasking does not work|Multitasking is a myth]], despite corporations valuing them as a skill.
	- The brain is incapable of paying attention to two things at the same time.
	- What "multitasking" is just switching from one task to another and that reduces productivity and increases mistakes by up to 50%.
- Participating in a online working group is a form of solitude on its own. 
	- Which makes you wonder why extroverts cannot take zoom calls for a long time (This passage is written in 2021, still with the pandemic)

### On Brainstorming
- Brainstorming has four rules:
	1. Don't judge or criticize ideas.
	2. Be freewheeling. The wilder the idea, the better.
	3. Go for quantity. The more ideas you have, the better.
	4. Build on the ideas of fellow group members.
