* â€˜liquid modernityâ€™ to describe our era, in which everything is in a state of perpetual change.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 277-278</sup></p>

* liquid modernity â€“ also referred to as flexible capitalism, post-Fordism and the consumer society â€“ rule number one is that you have to keep up.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 286-287</sup></p>

* Critics of the pace of change point out that it leads to a general feeling of alienation from the activities in which we are engaged, and to a constant sense that we donâ€™t have enough time. Technological advances should, in theory, free up time â€“ allowing us to have a kick-about with the kids, make pottery or discuss politics.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 295-298</sup></p>

* The decelerating individual â€“ who slows down instead of speeding up, and maybe even stops completely â€“ seems out of place in a culture characterised by manic development, and may be interpreted pathologically (i.e. diagnosed as clinically depressed).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 302-304</sup></p>

* All sorts of human interrelationships and practices related to what were considered personal matters in days of yore are now seen as tools and deployed by companies and organisations to drive staff development. Emotions and personal characteristics have been instrumentalised. If you canâ€™t stand the pace â€“ if you are too slow, lack energy or break down altogether â€“ the prescribed remedies are coaching, stress management, mindfulness and positive thinking.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 313-316</sup></p>

* But is it possible to plan for the long term when the world is so focused on the short term? Should you even try? Why bother when everything will inevitably change again? And yet, if you hold on to long-term ideals and stable objectives and values, youâ€™ll be seen as difficult and inflexible â€“ an â€˜enemy of changeâ€™, as the consultants would say. â€˜Think positive â€“ and seek solutionsâ€™ is the mantra, we donâ€™t want to hear any more whining or see any more sour faces. Critique is something to be quashed. Itâ€™s a source of negativity â€“ everyone knows that things work best when you just â€˜do what you do bestâ€™, right?

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 318-323</sup></p>

* Mobility trumps stability in an accelerating culture. You need to be fleet of foot, â€˜liquidâ€™, changeable, able to dance to multiple tunes and set off in any direction at any time. Stability and roots imply the opposite, that youâ€™re stuck in one place.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 326-328</sup></p>

* We are inclined to talk about people being â€˜stuckâ€™ rather than â€˜putting down rootsâ€™, and we donâ€™t mean it in any positive sense.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 332-333</sup></p>

* A few years ago, I saw an ad for InterContinental hotels that read: â€˜You canâ€™t have a favorite place until youâ€™ve seen them all.â€™ The strap line was accompanied by a photo of a tropical island and the question â€˜Do you live an InterContinental life?â€™ In other words, you canâ€™t feel connected to a particular place until youâ€™ve been everywhere. This is very much the extreme end of the mobility-versus-roots philosophy. To tie ourselves down is to cut ourselves off from the other great places in the world. Applied to other aspects of life, the message is patently absurd, despite being relatively commonplace: you canâ€™t have a favourite job until youâ€™ve tried them all. You canâ€™t have a favourite spouse until youâ€™ve â€˜testedâ€™ all potential partners.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 336-343</sup></p>

* in an age that prefers mobility to roots, people have profound difficulties in establishing stable relationships with others, including partners, spouses and friends. In most cases, their relationships with others are so-called pure relationships, i.e. based exclusively on emotions. Pure relationships have no external criteria, and practical considerations (e.g. financial security) play no part. They are simply about the emotional effect of communing with the other person. If I am â€˜the best version of myselfâ€™ when Iâ€™m with my partner, then the relationship is justified. Otherwise, itâ€™s not. We think of human relationships as temporary and replaceable. Other people are tools in our personal development rather than individuals in their own right.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 344-351</sup></p>

* Many people, unfortunately, buy into the idea that they can â€˜do anythingâ€™ (an idea foisted on the young in particular), so self-flagellation is a perfectly understandable reaction when their efforts prove inadequate. If you can do anything, then it must be your fault if success proves elusive in work or love (for Freud, â€˜lieben und arbeitenâ€™ were the two most significant existential arenas). Little wonder, then, that nowadays so many hanker after a psychiatric diagnosis to explain away perceived personal inadequacies.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 356-361</sup></p>

* Another semi-poetic strap line â€“ a slogan from the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, which makes products like the â€˜happy pillâ€™ Paxil â€“ says: â€˜Do more, feel better, live longerâ€™. These are the key goals in an accelerating culture, and psychoactive drugs help us achieve them: to do more (irrespective of what it might be?); feel better (no matter what triggered your emotions?); and live longer (irrespective of the quality of the extra years of life?).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 361-365</sup></p>

* â€˜weâ€™ â€“ lack purpose and direction, and run around looking for the latest recipe for happiness, progress and success. From a psychological perspective, this resembles a collective state of dependency. Carl CederstrÃ¶m and AndrÃ© Spicer call it the Wellness Syndrome.8 Some (fewer and fewer) are addicted to cigarettes and alcohol, but a growing majority of people seem to be dependent on advice from lifestyle mentors, self-developers and health gurus. Multitudes of coaches, therapists, self-development experts and positivity consultants have emerged to help us change and transition in the accelerating culture.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 387-392</sup></p>

* Those who stand firm are, paradoxically, those best equipped to cope with what the future brings.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 423-424</sup></p>

* As the Stoics knew, reflection on the brevity of life and its many inevitable problems leads to a sense of solidarity with others who are in the same boat â€“ i.e. everyone else. Negativity will give you the time and opportunity to look at, and critique, the problematic aspects of life. It will help you grow used to concentrating on what is important in life: doing what is right, i.e. doing your duty.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 442-446</sup></p>

* Cut out the navel-gazing Focus on the negative in your life Put on the No hat Suppress your feelings Sack your coach Read a novel â€“ not a self-help book or biography Dwell on the past

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 449-453</sup></p>

* The more you gaze lovingly at your navel, the worse you will feel. Doctors call it the health paradox â€“ the more help patients receive, the more they self-diagnose, the worse they feel. Most self-help gurus will urge you to base decisions on your gut feelings. Donâ€™t. Itâ€™s not a good idea (especially after a vindaloo). Once a year is enough when it comes to self-analysis. Summer holidays are a good time for it. To compound matters, this kind of soul-searching is often seen as a tool for â€˜finding yourselfâ€™. This will almost always end in disappointment, with you slumped on the sofa, munching Maltesers.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 494-499</sup></p>

* What you need to do is take an interest in what these people actually say, rather than how their utterances make you feel. You need to learn to look outwards, not inwards; to be open to other people, cultures and nature. You need to accept that the self does not hold the key to how to live your life. The self is merely an idea, a construct, a by-product of cultural history. As such, it is by its very nature more external than internal.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 513-517</sup></p>

* This turning inwards to the self that emerged from the anti-authoritarian spirit of the 1960s has subsequently been institutionalised in schools and workplaces in many countries. School students are expected to find answers not just in textbooks or in nature, but inside themselves as well.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 517-519</sup></p>

* Philip Cushman once posited that the depression epidemic in the West is explained by the fact that if you look inwards long enough â€“ if you dwell on how you feel, and use therapy to find yourself â€“ then depression will descend the moment you realise that there is, in fact, nothing there.3 If, as is constantly asserted, the meaning of life is to be found inside you, then finding nothing there renders it all pointless. By spending inordinate amounts of time on navel-gazing you risk ending up disappointed.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 554-559</sup></p>

* Only dictators enjoy the â€˜privilegeâ€™ of not having to fit in. And it may ultimately may be more of a curse than a privilege.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 565-566</sup></p>

* Pop psychology and contemporary culture propagate the notion that the real self â€“ the ego, the core, or whatever you want to call it â€“ lies within us, and that the processes of socialisation and the demands placed on us by other people create a manufactured self that must be overcome.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 584-586</sup></p>

* the idea that â€˜the answer is inside meâ€™ â€“ and that the purpose of life is therefore self-realisation â€“ may well have had a certain liberating appeal back in the 1960s. At that time, there was no shortage of good reasons to throw off the shackles of a rigid society that placed unnecessary restrictions on personal and human development. Honneth argues, however, that while this inward turn may well once have constituted a legitimate form of resistance to â€˜the systemâ€™ (patriarchy, capitalism, etc.), it has subsequently become the basis upon which the very same system now legitimises itself.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 600-605</sup></p>

* post-modern consumer society â€“ which in this book I call accelerating culture â€“ cultivates individuals who are flexible, changeable and constantly preoccupied with self-development and reinvention. To stand still in a society based on growth and consumption is akin to dissent. The self-realisation tsunami has aided and abetted the marketâ€™s demand for a servile and flexible workforce, which is why, over the last fifty years, all sorts of ostensibly progressive management and organisational theories have focused on â€˜the whole personâ€™, â€˜human resourcesâ€™ and the idea of self-realisation through work.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 605-610</sup></p>

* the humanisation of the workplace â€“ as well as the introduction of self-management by groups, the delegation of responsibility and personal development via work â€“ has led to what the sociologist Richard Sennett dubbed â€˜corrosion of characterâ€™ (the individual no longer has a firm foundation on which to stand), to an epidemic of stress and to a dehumanising breakdown in interpersonal loyalty and solidarity.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 629-633</sup></p>

* In the accelerating culture, constant demands to be innovative, creative and constantly go that one step further merely serve to cement the existing (lack of) order.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 633-634</sup></p>

* the idea of transforming society by breaking down oppressive

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 635-636</sup></p>

* the idea of transforming society by breaking down oppressive traditions and liberating yourself is now ingrained in societyâ€™s oppressive reproduction of itself. Soul-searching as a means of self-development or even self-realisation has become the key psychological driving force in the accelerating culture and all the problems it generates. So, not only will it make your own life better if you drop all this malarkey, society will benefit too.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 635-639</sup></p>

* they who deny that it makes sense to attempt to find yourself may just be the ones who are most themselves â€“ or at least have some kind of sense of self. Those who reject the whole find-and-develop-yourself ideology have more chance of living a life with a certain degree of integrity â€“ with joined-up and enduring identities â€“ and sticking to what is important in their lives.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 648-651</sup></p>

* what does have inherent value is fulfilling your obligations to the people with whom you are interconnected (i.e. doing your duty), and whether you â€˜are yourselfâ€™ while doing so is essentially meaningless. Often, the quest to find the self will even lead to others being sacrificed along the way, making it impossible for you to fulfil your duties and obligations to others properly.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 662-665</sup></p>

* The most obvious suggestion is to do something you donâ€™t want to do. Something that doesnâ€™t feel right inside but might nevertheless be right for reasons that have nothing to do with how it makes you feel. The modern Stoic William Irvine calls it a â€˜program for voluntary discomfortâ€™.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 676-679</sup></p>

* According to the Stoics, there are multiple, interconnected, advantages to practising doing things that donâ€™t â€˜feel right insideâ€™. Firstly, it helps us build up the strength to cope with whatever trials the future might hold. If comfort is all you know, and have ever known, it becomes extremely difficult to endure the discomfort that we inevitably encounter at some point in our lives, e.g. when we are sick and old, or when we lose someone close or something valuable. Secondly, it mitigates the fear of future misfortune if we practise discomfort on a minor scale. According to Irvine, enduring minor forms of discomfort teaches us that unpleasant experiences arenâ€™t necessarily something we should fear. Unknown futures are less frightening when you learn to cope with the concept that things wonâ€™t always feel good when you delve into yourself in search of answers. Thirdly, we appreciate what we have when weâ€™ve tried doing without.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 683-690</sup></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 687-689</sup></p>

* In Book 7 of his Meditations, the Roman emperorphilosopher Marcus Aurelius implored us to pay no heed to the â€˜agitations of the fleshâ€™. Succumbing to â€˜the agitations of the fleshâ€™ is probably the Roman version of â€˜looking inside yourselfâ€™ and following your gut feeling. He pleads with us to avoid it because otherwise we risk becoming slaves to our bodily urges.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 694-696</sup></p>

* Will-power is like muscle strength, the Stoics believed: the more we exercise it, the better and stronger it becomes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 699-700</sup></p>

* Self-control is one of the absolutely key virtues for the Stoics, albeit one that encounters a degree of adversity in our accelerating culture, with its penchant for â€˜living in the momentâ€™ and its exhortations to â€˜Just Do It!â€™ as the ad says. Put simply, we become better at insisting on what is important if we learn to resist all sorts of â€“ more or less random â€“ incentives (either from the stomach or from whatever other source they might assault your senses).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 701-705</sup></p>

* The best advice I can give about practising not seeking answers inside yourself, and doing something that you donâ€™t feel like doing, isnâ€™t to throw yourself into all sorts of silly things, but to practise doing something that has ethical value. Even if it doesnâ€™t feel good (because acting ethically doesnâ€™t always).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 705-708</sup></p>

* If you spend time thinking about you own mortality every day, youâ€™ll appreciate life more. This is the Stoic aphorism memento mori â€“ remember that you will die.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 752-754</sup></p>

* Step Two consists of learning to focus more on the negative aspects of your life. This has multiple advantages. First of all, it allows you to think and speak freely.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 762-763</sup></p>

* Secondly, focusing on the negative is the first step in dealing with problems. There may be little you can do to improve the weather on Saturday afternoon, but if you arenâ€™t allowed to point out woeful conditions in the workplace â€“ and you are only allowed to focus on success stories â€“ then youâ€™ll end up frustrated and resentful.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 765-768</sup></p>

* Thirdly, reflecting on all the negative things that might happen to you â€“ and inevitably will happen to you (even positive psychologists die eventually) â€“ will lead to greater appreciation of the life you are leading now.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 768-769</sup></p>

* The award-winning American professor of psychology Barbara Held has long criticised what she calls â€˜the tyranny of the positiveâ€™.1 She thinks positivity is particularly widespread in the USA, but has become a kind of universally accepted international pocket psychology in most Western countries â€“ we should all â€˜think positivelyâ€™, be â€˜resource-orientedâ€™ and see problems as interesting â€˜challengesâ€™. This phenomenon has now reached the point where seriously ill people are expected to â€˜learn from their illnessâ€™ and ideally emerge as a stronger person on the other side.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 776-781</sup></p>

* A typical book title might be How I Survived Stress â€“ And What It Taught Me, but youâ€™re unlikely to find a book called Iâ€™m Still Stressed â€“ Itâ€™s an Unending Nightmare.Not only do we suffer stress or illness and eventually die, weâ€™re also supposed to think itâ€™s all so enlightening and rewarding.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 785-788</sup></p>

* Fortunately, psychologists have started to wake up to this, including the critical psychologist Bruce Levine. Number one on his list of ways in which healthcare professionals add to the sum of human misery is the positive psychology mantra that victims should change their attitudes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 791-793</sup></p>

* Incidentally, number ten on Levineâ€™s list is â€˜depoliticisation of human sufferingâ€™, by which he means attributing all sorts of woes that befall people to their own personal inadequacies (lack of motivation, pessimistic outlook, etc.) rather than to external circumstances.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 794-797</sup></p>

* â€˜You just need to think positively!â€™ is one of the most offensive things you can say to people in need.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 794-794</sup></p>

* Barbara Held is one of the sharpest critics of positive psychology, which has developed explosively as a field of research since the late 1990s. Positive psychology can be seen as a scientific reflection of the accelerating cultureâ€™s fascination with positivity. It really took off in 1988, when Martin Seligman became president of the American Psychological Association.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 800-802</sup></p>

* Positive psychology rejects the focus on human problems and suffering that previously epitomised much of psychology (Seligman sometimes calls standard psychology â€˜negative psychologyâ€™).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 807-809</sup></p>

* However, in the hands of consultants and coaches â€“ or enthusiastic managers who have attended short courses in â€˜positive leadershipâ€™ â€“ positive psychology is rapidly reduced to a blunt tool used to stifle criticism. Some sociologists go so far as to talk about positivity fascism, which they identify in both positive thinking and appreciative inquiry.5 The concept describes the kind of mind control that can arise if you only ever look on the bright side of life.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 816-821</sup></p>

* Rather than writing a letter to the editor and discussing it in an open forum, the positive psychologists chose to malign my academic integrity to the management of my university. I mention the story because it is ironic that these positive psychologists were so reluctant to engage in open scientific discussion. Clearly, there are limits to openness and the appreciative approach.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 828-831</sup></p>

* Paradoxically, the incident confirmed my critique of the tyranny of the positive â€“ it revealed that negativity and criticism (especially of positive psychology itself!) must be eliminated, and apparently by any means possible.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 831-834</sup></p>

* A modern manager doesnâ€™t want to be seen as a hard and fast authority, giving orders and deciding everything, but as someone who exerts a completely different kind of soft power by â€˜invitingâ€™ staff members to conversations about â€˜successesâ€™ in order to â€˜maximise job satisfactionâ€™. Forget all about the fact that there is still a distinct asymmetry of power between management and staff, and that some goals are clearly more legitimate than others.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 849-852</sup></p>


* But everything has to be â€˜world classâ€™ or â€˜in the top 5â€™ nowadays â€“ and this success invariably lies at the end of a road paved with opportunities and successes. I call this â€˜coercive positivityâ€™. Only the best is good enough, and it is achieved simply by dreaming big and thinking positive.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 855-858</sup></p>

* According to critics of coercive positivity, including the aforementioned Barbara Held, one outcome of the unchallenged focus on positivity can be â€˜blaming the victimâ€™ â€“ i.e. explaining away forms of human suffering or inadequacy with reference to the individualâ€™s alleged lack of a sufficiently optimistic and positive attitude to life, or a paucity of the â€˜positive illusionsâ€™ advocated by positive psychologists (including Seligman).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 860-863</sup></p>

* Research suggests (although the results are not absolutely unambiguous) that people suffering from depression actually see themselves more realistically than people who are not suffering from depression. However, one fear is that the positive approach encourages a cultural requirement for positivity and happiness.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 865-867</sup></p>

* In the accelerating culture, this paradoxically causes suffering, as people feel guilty about not feeling constantly happy and successful (see the paradox machine discussed earlier).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 867-869</sup></p>


* Another â€“ but related â€“ criticism concerns the playing down of the importance of context that characterises parts of the positive approach. If the hypothesis here is that an individualâ€™s happiness depends primarily on â€˜internalâ€™ not â€˜externalâ€™ factors (e.g. various social factors associated with socioeconomic status, etc.), then itâ€™s your own fault if youâ€™re not happy.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 869-872</sup></p>

* This emphasis on the importance of â€˜the innerâ€™, of that which is under the control of our will-power, contributes to the problematic ideology that requires the individual to keep up and develop at all times â€“ which includes developing the capacity to think positively in order to survive in the accelerating culture.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 877-880</sup></p>

* Barbara Held posits an alternative to coercive positivity â€“ namely, complaining. She has even written a bestseller about how to moan and complain. Itâ€™s a kind of self-help book for curmudgeons: Stop Smiling, Start Kvetching.8

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 882-885</sup></p>

* The basic premise of Heldâ€™s moanersâ€™ charter is that life is never completely okay. Sometimes itâ€™s just slightly less not-okay. This means that there is always something to complain about.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 889-891</sup></p>

* Life is hard. But according to Held, this isnâ€™t our real problem. The real problem is that we are forced to pretend that life isnâ€™t hard. Youâ€™re expected to say â€˜Fine!â€™ when asked how youâ€™re doing.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 892-893</sup></p>

* Improving your ability to focus on the negative â€“ and complain about it â€“ gives you a coping mechanism that makes life slightly more manageable. But complaining and dissent arenâ€™t just about coping with situations.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 894-895</sup></p>

* The freedom to grumble comes from the ability to face reality and accept it as it is. It endows you with a type of human dignity, in stark contrast to the terminally positive individual, who zealously insists thereâ€™s no such thing as bad weather (just inappropriate clothing). Well actually, Mr Happy, bad weather is real â€“ and when itâ€™s bad, itâ€™s nice to be able to complain from the warmth of the pub.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 895-898</sup></p>

* We need to reserve the right to moan, even if it doesnâ€™t lead to positive changes. But if it can lead to positive changes then it is, of course, important. Usually, kvetching is directed outward.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 898-900</sup></p>

* By contrast, the positive attitude is directed inwards â€“ if somethingâ€™s wrong, we are required to work on ourselves and what motivates us. Everything is our own fault. Unemployed people arenâ€™t entitled to complain about the benefits system. They just need to get their act together, think positively and find a job. Itâ€™s all about â€˜believing in yourselfâ€™ â€“ but thatâ€™s a totally blinkered concept. It reduces important social, political and economic problems to a matter of individual motivation and positivity.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 901-906</sup></p>

* Dealing with something means mastering it, of course, or removing or abolishing the problem completely. But lots of things just canâ€™t be done away with like that. People are vulnerable and fragile, fall ill and eventually die. We canâ€™t just â€˜deal withâ€™ death in that sense of the phrase. But we can get on with life. In other words, accept problems but learn to live with them.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 910-912</sup></p>

* If something canâ€™t be changed, you might as well stand by it. Better to face reality than â€˜live in a foolâ€™s paradiseâ€™, as my gran would say. â€˜Better to be Socrates dissatisfied, than a fool satisfiedâ€™, as the British utilitarian John Stuart Mill said in the nineteenth century.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 912-914</sup></p>

* Not everything is possible. Not everything turns into positive happiness. However, there are other aspects of life that are worth striving for, such as dignity and a sense of reality. The point is that you must dare to face up to negativity.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 914-917</sup></p>

* You might be able to make some positive changes but, quite simply, the negative aspects of life are here to stay. Accept it. However, we must be allowed to complain and criticise. If we are blinkered, positive and optimistic all of the time, we run the risk of the shock being all the greater when things do go wrong for us. Focusing on the negative prepares you for future adversity. And complaining can also increase your awareness of the good things in life. â€˜Iâ€™ve got a sore toe â€“ but the rest of my leg doesnâ€™t hurt!â€™

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 917-921</sup></p>

* If you want to be better at acknowledging the negative aspects of life, I recommend the Stoic technique called negative visualisation.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 924-925</sup></p>

* As a counterbalance to such positive fantasies, you could take up constant complaining instead â€“ but this would soon exasperate those around you, especially if you didnâ€™t do it with a twinkle in your eye. Stoicismâ€™s negative visualisation provides a more appropriate way of practising negativity.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 929-932</sup></p>


* Senecaâ€™s letter to Marcia, who was still racked with grief three years after the death of her son, he writes that she must understand that everything in life is just â€˜on loanâ€™. Fortune can take away whatever she wishes, without warning. This realisation provides all the more reason to love what we have in the short time we have it. In another letter, Seneca warns that we shouldnâ€™t just think about death as something in the distant future. In principle, death can strike at any time:

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 933-937</sup></p>

* Let us always remember, therefore, that both we and all those we care about are mortal. ...Because I didnâ€™t think that way, fate struck me suddenly, and I was unprepared. Now I think both that everything is mortal, and that this does not follow any particular law. Everything that can possibly happen at some point, can happen today.

* Epictetus recommends â€“ directly and very specifically â€“ that we think about our childrenâ€™s mortality every time we kiss them goodnight. This may seem over the top, but it demands that we consider the possibility that our child might not wake up the next morning.12 It reminds us of our human mortality and, in doing so, strengthens our familial bonds and makes us better able to accept our childrenâ€™s mistakes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 942-946</sup></p>

* Epictetus would say that it is better to cradle a screaming baby in your arms than a lifeless one. The negative visualisation helps us to endure the screaming.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 947-949</sup></p>

* Ultimately, we need to consider our own mortality. Memento mori â€“ remember you will die.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 949-951</sup></p>

* As mentioned previously, contemporary culture encourages us to focus on the positive. Everybody talks about â€˜the good lifeâ€™ â€“ but not about learning to die well. Maybe we should.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 952-953</sup></p>

* â€˜he who has learned to die has unlearned to serveâ€™.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 954-955</sup></p>

* The purpose of thinking about death is not to be fascinated by it for its own sake. Rather, it is through becoming accustomed to the idea of the ultimate negative that we avoid being consumed by the fear of death â€“ and are therefore able to live better.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 955-957</sup></p>

* There are two aspects to negative visualisation, and here are two exercises to try: Think about losing something (or someone) you care for and note how this enhances the pleasure you derive from it/them. Psychologists speak of the concept of â€˜hedonic adaptationâ€™, i.e. that we very quickly get used to the good life. Negative visualisation can counteract hedonic adaptation and make you more grateful. Incidentally, hedonic adaptation is also studied by positive psychologists. Think about the fact that you will one day shed your mortal coil: Everybody grows old, falls ill and, in the end, dies. If you spend time thinking about this every day, then you will come to appreciate life more â€“ including in times of crisis. Death isnâ€™t just something you can â€˜deal withâ€™, but with a little practice you might be able to â€˜get on with lifeâ€™.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 957-965</sup></p>

* Saying â€˜I donâ€™t want to do thatâ€™ conveys strength and integrity. Only robots always say yes. For example, if youâ€™re at a performance and development review and your line manager wants you to take a â€˜personal developmentâ€™ course, just decline politely. Tell him youâ€™d prefer to introduce a â€˜cake dayâ€™ at work. Practise saying no to at least five things every day.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1013-1016</sup></p>

* The point is simply that you should reject the widespread misconception that â€˜the answer lies within youâ€™ and that youâ€™ll find it by â€˜looking inwardsâ€™. There is good reason to stand firm and resist the coercive positivity that permeates modern society, and tries to convince you that negativity is undesirable and dangerous.

* Learning to say no is an extremely important step in any childâ€™s development. While most parents (me included) want their offspring to be obedient to a certain extent, the first â€˜noâ€™ represents a crucial first step towards maturity and independence. As one child psychologist put it, â€˜the child now consciously enters into character as an individual and is capable of using language to distance itself from the parents. This act of opposition is the first step on the path to autonomy.â€™

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1024-1028</sup></p>

* The idea of â€˜stepping into characterâ€™ is important. Unlike popular psychology concepts such as personality and competencies (which you can â€˜work withâ€™ and â€˜developâ€™), the concept of character refers to shared moral values.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1029-1030</sup></p>

* The individual who insists on standing firm and supporting certain values based on their inherent worth â€“ and is therefore capable of saying no when these values are threatened â€“ has character.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1030-1032</sup></p>


* Integrity means that you donâ€™t just tag along with the latest trends. You live in accordance with a specific idea that is more important to you than everything else. Integrity means attempting to establish a coherent identity that transcends time and contexts â€“ and standing by it.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1032-1034</sup></p>

* The opposite of integrity means always wearing the Yes hat, never doubting that saying yes is good and that trying something new is always a good idea. This type used to be known as a â€˜flibbertigibbetâ€™. If saying no is crucial to independence, the good old flibbertigibbet, who never takes off the Yes hat, is the most dependent creature of all. If you only own a Yes hat, you risk falling victim to any old whim â€“ personal or external.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1034-1038</sup></p>

* To use an old socio-psychological term, you are â€˜externally controlledâ€™ if you live according to the axiom that itâ€™s always good to say yes to whatever is on offer.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1038-1039</sup></p>

* True internal control â€“ called integrity in this book â€“ consists of adhering to moral values, understanding the importance of obligations and duty, and using reason to determine what is good and right in a given situation. If you have integrity, you will often have to say no because so much of the accelerating culture deserves to be renounced.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1041-1044</sup></p>

* The term â€˜Yes hatâ€™ is usually something that we think other people should put on, but that they may be having trouble finding. In the workplace, you may be encouraged to don it if you are deemed not to be positive and development-oriented enough.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1047-1049</sup></p>

* Every single day we are faced with all sorts of temptations and inducements to which the answer should be no â€“ and fortunately we often get the answer right. So why the Yes hat, and why is it justified?

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1049-1051</sup></p>

* Nowadays, hordes of â€˜motivational speakersâ€™ clamour to help individuals and companies develop by saying yes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1052-1053</sup></p>

* Secondly, always having to say yes would reflect a rather servile image of humankind. Demanding that people say yes is degrading when it becomes a dogma that reduces people to servants who can be ordered to go anywhere, any time, and not put down roots.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1076-1078</sup></p>

* But why is the Yes hat so much more in than the No hat? I think there are two main reasons. The first stems from the pace of the accelerating culture and the changing nature of what it has to offer us. When everything feels liquid and mobile (whether that is truly the case or not), the Yes hat is a way of making yourself â€˜good enoughâ€™. It emits the signal that you are sufficiently enterprising to keep up with what is going on.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1078-1082</sup></p>

* The philosopher Anders Fogh Jensen describes our era as â€˜the project societyâ€™, one in which all sorts of activities and practices are conceived of as projects, and they are often fleeting, short-term and recyclable.3 He describes how, as individuals in this project society, we â€˜overbookâ€™ ourselves with appointments and projects in an attempt to use our capacity fully â€“ much like airlines do.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1082-1086</sup></p>

* The ability to squeeze out an enthusiastic â€˜Yes!â€™ is a core competency in the accelerating culture, something to double underline in job applications. â€˜Saying yes to new challengesâ€™ is considered unequivocally good, while a polite â€˜no thanksâ€™ is interpreted as a lack of courage and an unwillingness to change.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1087-1090</sup></p>

* The first reason why the Yes hat is far more popular than its negative counterpart is the social fear of not being sufficiently enterprising or â€˜on the ballâ€™. The second reason is more existential: it originates from the fear of missing out (sometimes abbreviated to FOMO). You put on the Yes hat not just to be attractive and â€˜employableâ€™ in the eyes of others, but also because life is finite, and youâ€™re supposed to think that itâ€™s important to â€˜make the most of itâ€™.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1090-1094</sup></p>

* The Stoics see nothing wrong with positive experiences per se, but donâ€™t see pursuing as many of them as possible as an end in itself. In fact, such a pursuit, decked out in a Yes hat and the latest fashionable gear, might stop you achieving peace of mind, the virtue that the Stoics cherish most.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1097-1100</sup></p>

* An inability to say no â€“ for example, because you are afraid of missing out on something â€“ will throw you off course. It becomes difficult to step back and accept your current circumstances. But in the accelerating culture, peace of mind is no longer deemed a desirable state. Itâ€™s a problem. People with peace of mind are precisely the type who are grounded enough to knock back all sorts of (unreasonable) requirements and demands. That is not an asset in an era when the ideal is the liquid, flexible, changeable individual.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1100-1104</sup></p>


* Advocates of the Yes hat often accuse those who don the No hat of a lack of courage, and of rigidity and caution. But you could equally assert that it is the philosophy of the Yes hat that clings to certainty.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1107-1109</sup></p>

* Stoic philosophy asserts the opposite: we do not know whether it is right to say yes, and this makes doubt the preferable option. If in doubt, the answer is usually no, so you should always have the No hat at hand. In other words, â€˜if it ainâ€™t broke, donâ€™t fix itâ€™. We know what we have now, but not what we will have in the future.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1112-1116</sup></p>

* In one sense, the contemporary world lauds certainty as never before. Certainty is good â€“ doubt is bad. The paradox is, of course, that of worshipping certainty while claiming everything constantly needs to develop and change. Maybe we worship certainty precisely because of the lack of it in our non-stop modern world?

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1116-1118</sup></p>

* Doubt and uncertainty have fallen out of favour, most likely because we live in what sociologists term a risk society, in which one of the by-products of development, especially in technology, is that new risks are constantly generated.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1123-1125</sup></p>

* In the risk society, you have to be absolutely sure in order to be heard. You need to issue confident proclamations: â€˜Research shows that serotonin deficiency in the brain is the cause of depressionâ€™; â€˜We know that children learn in four different waysâ€™; â€˜We now finally have a diagnostic system that deals with mental illness.â€™

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1128-1131</sup></p>

* In essence, certainty is necessarily dogmatic, whereas doubt has an important ethical value.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1131-1132</sup></p>

* certaintyâ€™s â€˜I knowâ€™ easily leads to blindness â€“ especially when you know that it is best to say yes. Doubt, on the other hand, leads to openness, to other ways of acting and new understandings of the world.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1132-1133</sup></p>

* The problem with doubt is that, in the accelerating culture, it is slow and harks back. It doesnâ€™t lend itself to quick decision-making based on gut feelings and positivity.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1135-1136</sup></p>

* if in doubt, the answer is usually no. If you are not in doubt, try thinking whether you should be.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1156-1157</sup></p>

* more regular use of the No hat would be conducive to standing on your own feet and being true to the essential things in life. If you always say yes, youâ€™ll be put off whatever you are supposed to be doing whenever someone says â€˜Hey you, come here!â€™

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1158-1161</sup></p>

* When it comes to the important issues in politics, ethics and the art of living, it is human in itself to be hesitant and have doubts. This is actually worth standing firm on in a risk society, where the answers â€“ and even sometimes the problems â€“ are unknown.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1168-1170</sup></p>

* The ideal is to stand firm on what you have, and accept that other people may have different worldviews. This is called tolerance.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1174-1175</sup></p>

* one of the tenets of the Stoic philosophy, and one that is particularly relevant in the accelerating culture of the twenty-first century: there may be no such thing as absolute truth, but that is exactly why it is up to us to create it in our own lives. There is no certainty in a rapidly changing world, but that is exactly why we have to be reliable, so we create islands of order and coherence in a world that is running amok. To create such islands requires that you are capable of saying no. In this sense, saying â€˜noâ€™ is a prerequisite for being able to stand firm.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1179-1184</sup></p>

* Initiatives are regularly pushed ahead in the name of progress, often leading to a considerable waste of time and effort.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1188-1189</sup></p>

* Managers shouldnâ€™t just get all excited and present staff with â€˜new visionsâ€™ to be given the nod. They should also pose the question: what unnecessary stuff can we cut out?

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1190-1192</sup></p>

* Perhaps you are even starting to realise that other people (children, friends, colleagues) arenâ€™t â€˜projectsâ€™, but human beings to whom you have commitments.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1199-1200</sup></p>

* I recommend that you turn down at least five things every day.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1204-1204</sup></p>

* If regularly saying no proves too much, try deploying doubt and hesitation to ensure that reflection and reconsideration are incorporated into your daily practice. Instead of immediately saying yes, try saying â€˜Iâ€™ll have to think about that.â€™

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1209-1211</sup></p>

* If youâ€™re always bubbly and positive, other people may suspect that your constant enthusiasm is a bit false. And if youâ€™re incapable of putting a lid on your anger, theyâ€™ll treat you like an unruly child. Adults should choose dignity over authenticity. So practise keeping your emotions under control. For example, once a day, try to think of someone who has insulted or offended you â€“ and send them a big beaming smile.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1235-1239</sup></p>

* you have to learn to harness your emotions â€“ especially the negative ones â€“ and sometimes you have to suppress them completely.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1242-1243</sup></p>

* If we are incapable of guilt, we canâ€™t understand ourselves as moral agents with responsibility for our own actions, especially our misdeeds. Guilt tells us that weâ€™ve done something wrong. Even if the emotion is negative, itâ€™s absolutely indispensable to living our lives fully.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1248-1250</sup></p>

* we arenâ€™t capable of feeling ashamed, then we have no way of sensing how the world around us feels about what we say or do. Shame is a sign that you are acting in a manner considered unacceptable by your own community. You might even say that it would be difficult to become a mature, thinking being â€“ with the character and integrity outlined in the previous chapter â€“ if you know no shame.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1250-1252</sup></p>

* Humanity is inextricably linked with morality, which is introduced via shame.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1255-1256</sup></p>

* being human is closely associated with the ability to feel shame. It is through shame that we see ourselves as others see us and assess who we really are. Without shame, we wouldnâ€™t be humans with a conscious ability to think for ourselves. In other words, we wouldnâ€™t possess the ability to relate to ourselves, which is a prerequisite for living a life based on reason.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1256-1260</sup></p>

* Since negative emotions are important, it is a worry if parents constantly try to shield their offspring from feelings of guilt and shame. These are the very emotions that lead the child into a moral universe, in which he or she will hopefully evolve, bit by bit, into a responsible stakeholder.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1261-1263</sup></p>

* Ultimately, we need to acknowledge the importance of negative feelings. The same goes for positive emotions, of course, such as joy, pride and gratitude. But we must be careful not to put absolute faith in emotions, as is the current trend in some quarters.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1264-1266</sup></p>

* So-called futurists talk about â€˜the emotional societyâ€™, while psychologists laud â€˜emotional intelligenceâ€™. A notion has been allowed to spread that in order to be authentic (which many see as the ideal) you must express your emotions when you experience them, regardless of whether theyâ€™re positive or negative.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1266-1268</sup></p>

* This will probably be at the expense of authenticity â€“ but there are plenty of reasons to be sceptical about that concept anyway. Instead of trying to be authentic at any cost, a rational adult should strive for a degree of dignity, which assumes the ability to control your emotions.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1270-1273</sup></p>

* The accelerating culture is also an emotional culture. The sociologist Zygmunt Bauman â€“ who, as previously mentioned, introduced the concept of â€˜liquid modernityâ€™ to characterise our own era â€“ has mapped the evolution from a culture based on prohibition to one based on commands. This trend encompasses a shift in outlook in relation to both emotions and morality.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1276-1280</sup></p>

* In a culture based on prohibition, morality consists of a set of rules that determine what you are not allowed to do or think. For instance, Freudâ€™s psychoanalysis was a clear reflection of a culture based on prohibition: society demanded that you suppress forbidden feelings, i.e. sexual drives, and sublimate them in accordance with established norms. If you were unable to do so, you developed neuroses, as a kind of psychopathological reaction to your excess of drives and emotions.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1280-1283</sup></p>

* The concept of neurosis doesnâ€™t even feature in the most recent diagnostic systems. Roughly speaking, neurosis was something that afflicted people in a society that demanded you put down roots, that required you to be stable and well-adjusted.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1283-1285</sup></p>

* Since then, mobility has replaced stability, and morals are no longer prohibition-based (you mustnâ€™t!) but command-based (you must!). Emotions were previously to be suppressed, but are now to be expressed.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1286-1288</sup></p>

* The accelerating culture does not take issue with the fact that people are emotional, enterprising and grasping. The problem is no longer an excess of emotions, but the lack of them.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1288-1290</sup></p>

* The problem today isnâ€™t the people who are (overly) flexible, itâ€™s the ones who are (overly) stable: they lack sufficient motivation, drive and craving to keep up with the ever-present demands for flexibility, adaptability and self-development.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1291-1292</sup></p>

* The category of mental disorder that denotes a lack of energy and an emotional emptiness is no longer neurosis, but depression.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1293-1293</sup></p>

* In an accelerating culture, there is no such thing as wanting too much. Instead, it is those who want more who win. One way of describing the issue now might be to call it the â€˜energy problemâ€™: I never get enough done! I donâ€™t have enough motivation, emotion and passion! Just look at the number of areas where the concept of â€˜passionâ€™ has crept in. A typical life coach, for example, will ask clients whether they live a sufficiently passionate life. By decoding the coachâ€™s words, we arrive at an accurate picture of the current command culture:

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1295-1299</sup></p>

* In the accelerating culture, words like â€˜passionateâ€™, â€˜loveâ€™ and â€˜funâ€™ are increasingly associated with our working lives. This has led the sociologist Eva Illouz to describe the modern age as that of an â€˜emotional capitalismâ€™, in which economics and emotions are intertwined.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1303-1307</sup></p>

* Emotional capitalism is a culture of emotions, in which feelings play a significant part in personal transactions between individuals. It is our emotional competencies that make us attractive in the markets (for both work and love).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1307-1309</sup></p>

* The concept of â€˜emotional workâ€™ is well described in sociological literature. It has long been particularly characteristic of the service sector, e.g. flight attendants who smile and are always cheerful to keep up the spirits of stressed and perhaps nervous passengers. Even while being abused, they respond in a positive and welcoming manner, which can be quite taxing for them.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1309-1311</sup></p>

* In organisations with flat management structures and plenty of teamwork, itâ€™s seen as crucial that youâ€™re able to be positive, co-operative and flexible in your human interrelationships.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1316-1318</sup></p>

* The same applies to the modern manager, who has to be equally passionate. Essentially, emotional life has been commercialised or commodified â€“ we buy and sell emotions in the labour market.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1318-1319</sup></p>

* If we lack emotional competencies (or emotional intelligence, to use the psychological buzzword), then we run the risk of being sent on a personal development course to get in better touch with ourselves.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1319-1322</sup></p>

* As you should know by now, too much introversion is a bad thing â€“ itâ€™s part of the problem rather than part of the solution (to stick with the utterly bogus lingo of self-development). Instead of a self-development course, you could take an interest in the origins of the emotional culture.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1322-1324</sup></p>

* the historian Richard Sennett wrote about â€˜the fall of public manâ€™. Public man lived in the old prohibition culture, in which his comings and goings in the public sphere were regulated by established rituals. He wore masks, rather than act authentically and play out his feelings in front of others. Sennett describes how this polite form of social convention gradually disappeared as the authenticity ideal gained ground â€“ in particular, around the time of the countercultural movements of the 1960s.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1325-1329</sup></p>

* He argues that societies have a need for rituals, as a precondition for people spending time together in civilised ways. There is nothing inauthentic about basing your behaviour in public on certain ritualised social conventions.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1331-1332</sup></p>

* He goes as far as to say that the modern age has produced a contempt for rituals, and that this makes us more culturally primitive than the simplest tribe of hunter-gatherers.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1333-1335</sup></p>

* Modern societyâ€™s pursuit of the authentic and emotional has given us what Sennett has dubbed the â€˜tyranny of intimacyâ€™, in which the ideal of human relations has become the emotionally based, authentic encounter (in private life, in education and at work).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1335-1337</sup></p>

* Modern societyâ€™s pursuit of the authentic and emotional has given us what Sennett has dubbed the â€˜tyranny of intimacyâ€™, in which the ideal of human relations has become the emotionally based, authentic encounter (in private life, in education and at work). However, this ideal just leads to people constantly hurting each other.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1335-1338</sup></p>

* We have lost our sense of â€˜civilityâ€™ or politeness, which Sennett defines as social conventions that protect people from each other but still let them enjoy each otherâ€™s company. Wearing a mask is the essence of civility, Sennett writes in The Fall of Public Man.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1339-1341</sup></p>

* The growing emotional culture and therapisation of a range of social arenas is, from this perspective, deeply problematic, as we are increasingly invited to make our outward behaviour correspond with what we feel inside. On the whole, it is problematic â€“ as we learned in Step One â€“ to base choices on inner feelings.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1343-1345</sup></p>

* As a rule, our feelings donâ€™t constitute a foundation on which to stand firm. Rather, they change in response to prevailing circumstances and trends. Itâ€™s an illusion to believe that delving deep into your inner feelings is the path to authenticity.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1354-1356</sup></p>

* In essence, the worship of authenticity in the pursuit of true feelings infantilises us. The toddler who is swaddled in his feelings â€“ who smiles when happy and cries when frustrated â€“ is therefore implicitly presented as the ideal.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1358-1359</sup></p>

* As an adult, you should instead admire those who are capable of controlling â€“ even suppressing â€“ negative emotions. You should also be careful not to casually hurl around positive emotions.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1360-1361</sup></p>

* The research into this is ambiguous. Suppressing and inhibiting emotions has long been associated with all sorts of ills â€“ from low self-esteem to cancer. But the research findings point in many different directions. For example, some studies show that people with a tendency to suppress feelings such as anger run a greater risk of falling ill, and even contracting cancer â€“ if they are women. For men, the opposite would appear to be the case. Men are more at risk of cancer if they give free rein to their anger.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1368-1373</sup></p>

* However, I donâ€™t think you should put too much faith in findings like these, as the evidence is often open to interpretation, and, therefore, an insufficient basis for a philosophy of life.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1374-1375</sup></p>


* In their critique of the contemporary therapisation of life, psychiatrist Sally Satel and philosopher Christina Hoff Sommers summarised the research, suggesting that emotional restraint â€“ and even outright suppression of feelings â€“ can be healthy and conducive to a good life. They conclude that for most people, unbridled emotional openness would not help them achieve good mental health, and that it might instead be beneficial to put a lid on their emotions â€“ even in the wake of tragedy and loss.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1375-1379</sup></p>

* Another objection is that suppressing emotions can damage self-esteem, because you learn that your emotions may be wrong. The obvious answer here is that of course emotions are wrong sometimes. If I react with frenzied anger because my toddler spills milk on the table, my emotions are not right! If I cheat at golf but still preen with pride at winning the tournament, my emotions are warped!

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1380-1383</sup></p>


* It is important to recognise that feelings are not always legitimate and should be controlled and suppressed. This is perhaps especially true of negative emotions like envy, anger and contempt â€“ but of others, too.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1384-1385</sup></p>

* In our emotional culture, we are constantly told that itâ€™s good to have high self-esteem and that low self-esteem is to blame for all sorts of ills. In fact, there is a great deal of evidence to suggest that the biggest social problems stem not from low but from high self-esteem, which is statistically associated with psychopathy and immorality.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1386-1389</sup></p>

* Often, people tend to be angrier when they first learn to let rip. As an adult, you must master the art of emotional diversion â€“ i.e. distracting yourself from your own anger, envy, etc., in order to reduce and even eventually suppress negative emotions.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1392-1394</sup></p>

* Psychological studies also suggest that if you put aside your negative emotions, you will be less likely to remember the unpleasant episodes associated with them. You may recall the unpleasant things in life â€“ e.g. if someone has mortally offended you â€“ not just because they were unpleasant experiences, but because you yourself reacted strongly to them.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1394-1398</sup></p>

* According to the Stoic mindset, suppressing anger will lead to greater peace of mind and fewer bad memories that are capable of knocking us off balance.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1398-1400</sup></p>

* Unlike ordinary self-help books, which have a tendency to recommend one specific solution (e.g. positive thinking), the message of this book is that reality is complex and there is never a simple answer.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1403-1404</sup></p>

* The goal for a Stoic is precisely the ability to focus on the negative without being angry â€“ and either just accept it as an aspect of life, or try to bring about positive change if thereâ€™s something you can actually do about it in practice.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1405-1408</sup></p>

* The basic idea is that anger is a key human emotion. Only adults can be angry â€“ children and small animals can become aggressive or frustrated, but we rarely talk about â€˜the angry babyâ€™ or â€˜an angry catâ€™.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1412-1414</sup></p>

* The reason for this is that anger requires a reflective self-awareness not developed until adulthood and after we have acquired a sense of shame. Seneca defines anger as a revenge impulse.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1414-1416</sup></p>

* Although this impulse is very human, he emphasises that life is too short to waste on anger. You might want to see anger as a waste product of our selfconsciousness, one that we need to tolerate, but also one that we seek to dispose of as soon as possible.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1416-1418</sup></p>

* Humour is one of the key techniques for managing and defusing anger. According to Seneca, laughter is a helpful response to that at which we would otherwise be angry.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1418-1419</sup></p>

* Seneca stresses that when you get angry (which isnâ€™t always avoidable), you should apologise for it. This repairs social relationships and may also strengthen the self. The act of apologising will often get you past whatever made you angry in the first place.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1423-1426</sup></p>

* His example is one in which your slave smashes a cup and it makes you angry. (This is, of course, specific to Ancient Rome. If you have a tendency to react with anger to the idea of slavery, you might wish to adjust this example to a different context.) Instead, imagine that it is your friendâ€™s slave who smashes a cup in their house. Were that the case, youâ€™d probably consider your friendâ€™s anger totally unreasonable, and you would try to calm them down.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1426-1431</sup></p>

* Epictetus recommended â€˜projective visualisationâ€™ as a technique to suppress anger.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1426-1426</sup></p>

* consider the impermanence of all things in order to avoid anger and frustration when those things disappear. If a cup is broken, it may well be a pity â€“ especially if it was valuable â€“ but from the perspective of eternity, where everything is ultimately doomed to perish, it is an extremely small and insignificant matter.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1432-1435</sup></p>

* Life is far too short for anger. You must learn to repress emotions that disturb your peace of mind and prevent you standing firm. If you want to stand firm, it is a precondition that you arenâ€™t easily knocked off your stride. We are constantly bombarded with appeals to our emotions â€“ on television, in social media and in advertising â€“ and this constantly changes what we want.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1435-1438</sup></p>

* If you constantly pursue ephemeral desires, you canâ€™t stand firm. And if you canâ€™t stand firm, you arenâ€™t in a position to do your duty.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1438-1439</sup></p>

* You should therefore learn to suppress your feelings. This may be at the expense of authenticity â€“ which is in itself a benefit. It bestows a certain degree of dignity on an individual to be in control of their emotions. Practise wearing masks. Practise not being affected by the pettiness of others. Once youâ€™ve practised this, youâ€™ll be ready for the next step: firing your coach.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1439-1442</sup></p>

* Coaching and therapy have become ubiquitous development tools in our accelerating culture. A coach is supposed to help you find the answers within yourself and realise your full potential. But this is so wide of the mark. Consider sacking your coach and making friends with him or her instead.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1482-1484</sup></p>

* Coaching promises that â€˜you will find the answers inside yourselfâ€™, but you now know that this is an illusion. Coaching is perhaps the most visible manifestation of everything thatâ€™s wrong with an accelerating culture in which it is difficult to stand firm.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1489-1491</sup></p>


* The concept of coaching is based on constant development and change â€“ regardless of direction and content. It is its own raison dâ€™Ãªtre. This is the case whether it is a service for sale, something managers

* â€˜coachification of lifeâ€™ (which could also be called therapification): the trend of surrounding ourselves with â€“ and being dependent on â€“ all sorts of self-development technology, most clearly embodied in the figure of the coach.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1496-1497</sup></p>


* By preaching development, positivity and success, the coach is the counterpoint to the Stoicsâ€™ praise for the peace of mind arrived at by standing still and standing firm. I use the term â€˜preachingâ€™ pointedly, because the coach is a bit like a high priest of our age, and has a quasi-religious obsession with the development and realisation of the self. The coachification of life Coaching has been a growth sector for many years.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1498-1504</sup></p>

* Coaching has been a growth sector for many years. It has spread from the world of sport to education, business and life in general (in the guise of life coaching). In the accelerating culture, coaching is akin to a religion of the self.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1504-1506</sup></p>

* Coaching has become a standardised way of stagemanaging interpersonal relationships, especially when someone has identified a need for (self-)development.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1514-1515</sup></p>

* Coaching has become a key psychological tool in a culture that revolves around the self. As such, coaching is part of a more wide-ranging worldview that we might â€“ slightly provocatively â€“ dub the religion of the self.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1519-1522</sup></p>


* The religion of the self has taken over many of the functions of Christianity: the role of the priest is now played by a psychotherapist or coach; religious denominations have given way to therapy, coaching and other techniques for personal development; grace and salvation have been replaced by self-realisation, skills enhancement and lifelong learning. And finally, perhaps most importantly, where God used to be at the centre of the universe, now it is the self. Never before in history have we talked so much about the self and its characteristics (self-esteem, self-confidence, self-development, etc.). Never before have we had so many ways to measure, evaluate and develop the self â€“ even though we basically have no idea what it is.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1522-1528</sup></p>

* Unlike Christianity, the religion of the self does not have an external authority (God) to set the frameworks for life and human development. Instead, we have an inner authority (the self) that we now believe to be the guiding light of our lives.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1528-1529</sup></p>

* The modern teacher is not an odious authoritarian conveying vast swathes of knowledge to a general audience, but a quasi-therapist or coach who personally facilitates the studentsâ€™ â€˜all-round personal developmentâ€™.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1532-1533</sup></p>

* Similarly, modern managers are no longer remote authoritarians concerned solely with hiring, firing and administration, but listening, introspective therapists who, e.g. in performance and development reviews or coaching sessions, strive to develop the personal skills of their staff.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1537-1539</sup></p>

* When we go to work, the self goes with us â€“ so we need to develop it in marketable directions. Above all else, it is imperative that we see ourselves as material for skills-enhancement projects.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1539-1541</sup></p>

* The danger of coaching is, of course, that you will never be allowed to stand still. Thereâ€™s always room for improvement â€“ and if you donâ€™t improve, itâ€™s your own fault.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1553-1555</sup></p>

* The message is that everything is possible if you believe in it enough and want it enough. If things donâ€™t work out, itâ€™s because you havenâ€™t mobilised enough will and motivation. The consequence of this is that you automatically criticise yourself when something is problematic: you internalise external social critique and transform it into inner self-criticism.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1555-1559</sup></p>

* One problematic tendency in coaching is that if youâ€™re in a rut, exhausted, down, or running on empty, coaching is advocated as the panacea. The problem is, of course, that the exhaustion and emptiness may have been caused by the requirement for constant self-development and improvement.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1560-1562</sup></p>

* The very core of the religion of the self is the idea that the answers are to be found inside you. This both determines the direction of the development (where do I want to go?) and acts as a measuring stick for its success (when will I be good enough?). But given that this measuring stick is subjective, i.e. not bound by external standards, there is a risk of trying to develop in an endlessly expanding vacuum. When should I stop? â€˜Constant Never-ending Improvementâ€™ is the key phrase. You will never be good enough.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1566-1571</sup></p>

* One of Anthony Robbinsâ€™ many well-known inspirational statements is: â€˜Success is doing what you want, when you want, where you want, with whom you want, as much as you want.â€™

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1571-1572</sup></p>

* Taken to the extreme, this way of thinking resembles psychopathy or antisocial personality disorder, because it encourages you to do whatever it takes to get whatever you want. Other people are, at best, instruments at your service, used to maximise your happiness and success.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1573-1575</sup></p>

* If we were to raise our children according to this definition of success, weâ€™d just tell them whatever they want is good enough and that the point of education should be to teach them how to realise these desires. This is a clear example of the subjectivism that prevails in the accelerating culture and is encouraged by coaches via the religion of the self.

* live. The traditional concept of upbringing is based on the idea that there are things outside of the self that are worth knowing. It is generally accepted that it is the job of parents (but also nursery and school teachers) to bestow upon their wards the character and integrity discussed in the previous step, so that they recognise and remain within those social boundaries. But if you believe that everything comes from inside the self â€“ ambitions, values, ideals â€“ then the person bringing up the child is reduced to the status of a sounding board.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1578-1583</sup></p>

* Children raised in this way would probably become adults who focus on their inner impulses rather than understanding what is important in life and fulfilling their duties as human beings. They would be experts at looking inwards, capable of prioritising their own preferences and working out how best to realise them. But ultimately they would just be intelligent children.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1586-1588</sup></p>

* In other words, they wouldnâ€™t realise that there are things that you should do because theyâ€™re important, not because you want to do them (or not). There are aspects of life that are important, regardless of how individuals feel about them â€“ but this idea is pooh-poohed in coaching and the religion of the self.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1589-1592</sup></p>


* According to Aristotle, a friend is a person with whom you spend time from which you both derive mutual pleasure. However, you also want the best for your friend for their own sake, and not just because you might benefit from them feeling good. A friendship is therefore a relationship that has its own intrinsic value: a friend is someone you help for the friendâ€™s sake.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1598-1601</sup></p>

* If you help others only to benefit yourself, then it is not strictly speaking a friendship, but a partnership based on an implicit contract (Iâ€™ll scratch your back, you scratch mine).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1601-1602</sup></p>

* Quid pro quo (something for something) applies in many human relationships, e.g. between employer and employee, but not in the relationship between parents and children (where you have a duty to be there for the kids, regardless of whether you think that, as a parent, you â€˜get something out of itâ€™). According to Aristotle, there is no quid pro quo between friends either.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1602-1605</sup></p>

* The question is whether the religion of the self, with its focus exclusively on the individualâ€™s preferences, and in which the coach provides tools for self-development, can be interpreted as a modern form of friendship. The answer is clearly no â€“ the relationship between coach and client is the very epitome of an instrumental relationship. It is only maintained as long as the parties derive benefit from it and is often based on financial interest (coaching is a business after all).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1607-1610</sup></p>

* one of the aspects of a more wide-ranging trend in the accelerating culture: that it is harder and harder to build proper friendships.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1613-1614</sup></p>

* The term â€˜friendâ€™ is already beginning to sound archaic (at least outside of the demeaning use of the term on Facebook), and there is a tendency to refer to â€˜networksâ€™ instead of circles of friends. But a network is instrumental. It is something you maintain, nurture and develop in order to mobilise it when needed.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1614-1616</sup></p>

* If you want to change jobs, you start by asking around in your network. Sociologists measure the range and strength of the network both qualitatively and quantitatively, as a form of â€˜social capitalâ€™. In this context, the concept of capital isnâ€™t really metaphorical. It signifies the commodification of personal relationships and the diminishment of real friendships.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1616-1618</sup></p>

* friends are defined by their own value in a personâ€™s life â€“ they are not just a resource to be utilised in the quest to get the most out of your own life. In other words, real friends are not something you buy.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1619-1621</sup></p>

* A true friend is someone for whom you want the best, someone you are willing to help even if you derive no benefit from the interaction. You can only hope that somebody considers you a true friend. In friendship, as in love, there are no binding contracts. So reintroduce the concepts of friendship and circles of friends, and sack your coach.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1628-1631</sup></p>

* I would recommend two types of shared activity that might provide fertile soil for this budding new friendship: a cultural activity and a nature activity, represented by the museum and the forest. A museum is a collection of objects from the past (near or distant), e.g. art or artefacts that say something about a particular era or an aspect of the human experience.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1634-1636</sup></p>

* In other words, the trick is to learn to appreciate things that canâ€™t be â€˜usedâ€™ for some other function. A museum exhibits and celebrates items that, from one perspective, are little more than old (or new) junk.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1638-1639</sup></p>

* Similarly, a walk in the woods gives us a sense of being part of nature and an understanding that it shouldnâ€™t be seen as consisting of resources that exist merely to meet human needs and desires. The grass, the trees and the birds existed long before people, and will probably outlast us all. They arenâ€™t there for our sake.

* Biographies always top the bestseller lists, but often they just celebrate the trivial lives of celebrities and reinforce the idea that life is something we control. Self-help books do the same. Ultimately, they leave you despondent at your failure to realise their myriad promises of happiness, wealth and health. Novels, on the other hand, enable you to understand human life as complex and unmanageable. Read at least one a month.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1690-1694</sup></p>

* I also think that there is something about the linear progression of the biography, in which events happen in chronological order, that has a reassuring effect in an accelerating culture that otherwise seems to be running amok.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1699-1701</sup></p>

* Both self-help books and autobiographies celebrate the self as the most important aspect of life â€“ but it is rarely a self that is in any form of balance in terms of integrity and moral values. Instead, it is usually a self that is doomed to eternal development and change.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1701-1703</sup></p>


* Step Six seeks to break your dependence on this kind of literature of the self, which reinforces the idea that life is something it is possible to control â€“ if only you know and develop yourself.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1705-1706</sup></p>

* Way back in the twentieth century, the philosopher Charles Taylor analysed how what he called the ethics of authenticity (i.e. that life is about being true to yourself) could result in new forms of dependence, in which people who are unsure of their identity need all sorts of self-help guides. What causes uncertainty about identity and leads to a risk of dependency? Taylor says that itâ€™s because we have begun to worship the self in a way that seals us off from everything outside us: history, nature, society and anything else that originates from external sources.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1706-1711</sup></p>

* Self-help literature is part of the problem, and should be ignored. However, since reading is generally a good thing, I recommend you throw yourself into a different type of literature instead â€“ namely novels.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1714-1716</sup></p>

* Unlike self-help books and most autobiographies, novels present life more faithfully â€“ as complex, random, chaotic and multifaceted. Novels remind you how little control you have over your life, and also show how it is inextricably entangled with social, cultural and historical processes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1716-1719</sup></p>


* Recently, the psychologist and sociologist Ole Jacob Madsen critiqued self-help literature from a cultural perspective.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1723-1724</sup></p>

* Madsen sees a strong ideological imbalance behind most self-help literature, in which each individual is made responsible for their own destiny and must seek individual solutions to social problems.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1726-1728</sup></p>

* It is a fundamental paradox that self-help literature, on the one hand, celebrates the individual, their freedom of choice and their self-realisation, and on the other, helps create people who are increasingly addicted to self-help and therapeutic intervention(s).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1728-1730</sup></p>

* It is claimed that self-realisation results in self-sufficient adults, but it actually creates infantile, dependent adults who think that the truth lies within them.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1730-1732</sup></p>

* Madsen begins his thoughtful analysis by citing Will Fergusonâ€™s satirical novel about the self-help industry, called simply Happiness.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1732-1733</sup></p>

* This hilarious satire draws our attention to one incontestable fact: self-help books donâ€™t work! The reason thousands of self-help books are published â€“ all promising to help us realise ourselves, develop and become â€˜the best version of ourselvesâ€™ â€“ is precisely because they have no particular effect.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1740-1742</sup></p>

* Or, to persist with the dependency metaphor, as the effects wear off faster and faster, an addict needs more and more drugs.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1742-1743</sup></p>

* In this sense, the self-help industry reflects the accelerating cultureâ€™s consumer mentality, as the products (including books) that promise to help readers find themselves are actually about endlessly changing the self instead â€“ the â€˜Constant Never-ending Improvementâ€™ that Anthony Robbins preaches.

* The same goes for the second biggest literary genre of the day: biographies. They constantly top the bestseller lists, because we want to read about how famous people go about realising themselves. Apparently, this is something achieved earlier and earlier in life, as the subjects of biographies are getting younger and younger.

* This is literature that describes a particularly traumatic experience (a crisis, divorce or mental breakdown) as a gift. Simply by thinking positively about your pain, it is transformed into a resource that gives you greater insight into yourself and ultimately improves your life.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1755-1758</sup></p>

* Autobiographies rarely describe crises that have exclusively negative outcomes. Far more often, crises and adversity are presented as opportunities for personal growth and development.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1758-1759</sup></p>

* However, after reading this book, you also know that crises and adversity can also be just what they appear to be â€“ horrible situations from which nothing good will ever come. More often than you might think, the best thing to do is to strive to live with dignity, by looking the negative in the eye and accepting it. But you wonâ€™t learn that from typical self-help books or autobiographies (instead, look to Seneca and Marcus Aurelius for inspiration).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1759-1763</sup></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1769-1770</sup></p>

* The novel â€“ one of the first of which was Cervantesâ€™ Don Quixote in 1606 â€“ portrays a particular individualâ€™s experience of the world, and explores how their perspective informs the world as portrayed in the book. This is in contrast to earlier literature, e.g. medieval canonical narratives in folk songs and stories, which portrayed â€˜everyoneâ€™ by focusing on general situations that represented universal experience.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1770-1774</sup></p>

* A recurring theme in Houellebecqâ€™s work is the absolute commodification of human relations in the accelerating consumer society. In his novels, almost every relationship is characterised by an exchange of services, in which the individualâ€™s experience is their most precious asset â€“ that against which everything in life is measured.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1838-1840</sup></p>

* Houellebecqâ€™s novels teach us that the pursuit of the self and self-realisation are basically reflections of late capitalist society, in which even the most intimate relationships are subject to commodification and instrumentalisation. Life is about experiencing as much as possible without finding external standards on which to stand firm, and therefore â€˜the destruction of moral values in the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties and Nineties was a logical, almost inevitable, processâ€™.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1841-1845</sup></p>

* It may well be that neither Houellebecq nor KnausgÃ¥rdâ€™s books are correct in the objective sense (and both have been the subject of lawsuits, because they write about real places and people). However, in a deeper sense, I think that their books offer true descriptions of our lives, precisely because they lack illusions and focus on negative aspects. They donâ€™t present us with a grand Truth with a capital T (which, in any case, probably only exists for the religious among us), but offer true depictions of aspects of life in the accelerating culture.

* How do novels teach us to stand firm? By helping us find an external meaning or perspective on life upon which to do it. At least, that is the thesis of the book All Things Shining by the influential American philosophers Hubert Dreyfus and Sean Kelly. As the subtitle suggests, they want you to read the Western classics to find meaning in a secular age â€“ a world without God.

* If you think things are bad now, just remember that they can always get worse. And probably will. The past, on the other hand, has a tendency to become lighter and brighter, the further it fades into the distance. When someone presents plans for innovation and â€˜visionsâ€™ for the future, tell them that everything was better in the old days. Explain to them that the idea of â€˜progressâ€™ is only a few hundred years old â€“ and is, in fact, destructive. Practise repeating yourself. Look for role models who have put down roots. Insist on the right to stand still.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1927-1932</sup></p>

* The accelerating culture is at one and the same time preoccupied by the moment and the future, but is definitely not particularly bothered about the past.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1932-1933</sup></p>


* What distinguishes humankind is surely our ability to transcend the connection to the present moment and, in a unique sense, draw on the past. Why has it become so unfashionable to look back at the past? Well, if this bookâ€™s analysis is valid, this phenomenon is connected with the accelerating culture, which is, by definition, future-oriented and focused on constantly producing new ideas.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1953-1956</sup></p>

* There are even companies, institutions and consultants that specialise in â€˜future studiesâ€™ â€“ the idea being that itâ€™s crucial to spot trends in order to prepare for what lies ahead and help shape the future. In fact, futurists are more concerned with creating the future than researching it. They sell ideas and concepts (of the dream society, the leisure society, the emotional society and whatever else it has been called over the years) to their customers, who then adapt to what they have been told is just around the corner. This prediction then comes true precisely because they have prepared (and paid) for it.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1956-1961</sup></p>


* Once again, we find ourselves mired in a paradox: the way in which we prepare for the future shapes the future as a reflection of the way in which we prepared for it!

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1961-1962</sup></p>

* should replace progress with repetition and learn to dwell on the past. This is a more accurate expression of our humanity and reflects a mature attitude to life.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1972-1973</sup></p>

* Memory provides a basis on which to act in new and unknown situations â€“ it is not a tool for recalling the past for its own sake. But recall is also characteristic of the human adult. We draw on the past and our experience to learn how to live our lives (to which I return below) and develop our culture.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1974-1977</sup></p>


* We have created a culture that draws up visions, makes plans and runs workshops about the future, and it is for precisely this reason that we forget our past insights and achievements far too easily.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1982-1984</sup></p>

* Concepts like innovation and creativity float around in all sorts of discourse about organisation and education, in which any sense of the value of repetition and the tried and tested has been lost. We are forever being told to â€˜think outside the boxâ€™.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1984-1986</sup></p>

* Fortunately, less excitable creativity researchers have pointed out that it only makes sense to think outside the box if you know that there is a box (and what itâ€™s made of).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1986-1987</sup></p>

* The new only makes sense within a horizon of something known. If you know nothing of the past and its traditions, itâ€™s impossible to create anything new that is useful.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1989-1990</sup></p>

* To know and be able to dwell on your own past is a prerequisite for maintaining a relatively stable identity, and thus also for our moral relationships with others. If we want to live well in the moral sense, itâ€™s crucial that we know how to reflect on our own personal past.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1994-1996</sup></p>

* Acknowledging your past mistakes â€“ and dwelling on them without, of course, allowing them to fester and torment you â€“ will help you to act properly. In addition to the moral teachings found in our history, itâ€™s also important for our self-understanding to think about our lives as something extending backwards into the past â€“ it is there that we find the roots of our identity.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1997-2000</sup></p>

* Knowing your past is a prerequisite for standing firm â€“ because without the past, there is nothing to stand firm on.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2005-2006</sup></p>

* Several philosophers have argued this in recent years, including the aforementioned Charles Taylor, who thinks concentrating on the moment is only possible if you have a past to which you are able to relate.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2006-2007</sup></p>

* Self-constancy â€“ personal integrity or identity â€“ is a basic precondition for trust between people â€“ and hence for ethical life. We can only make promises and commit to actions together over time because we understand ourselves as being the same over time â€“ because we have a more or less coherent identity.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2021-2023</sup></p>

* We must therefore learn to strive for self-constancy that refers to the past, rather than self-development that refers to the future.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2024-2025</sup></p>

* Perhaps the argument can even be honed down to such an extent that only individuals with self-constancy feel guilt and are capable of being moral (apropos Mark Twain on a clear conscience as the sure sign of a bad memory).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2031-2033</sup></p>

* There is an intrinsic connection between the sense of guilt and the concept of the promise â€“ both are fundamental human phenomena. If we didnâ€™t have the ability to make promises, then marriages or other long-term relationships based on fidelity (perhaps even â€˜till death do us partâ€™) would be impossible. Nor would it be possible to enter into agreements and contracts for goods or property (â€˜I promise to pay tomorrowâ€™). Day-to-day life couldnâ€™t function either, as it is based on the constant making of promises (â€˜Iâ€™ll do the dishesâ€™) â€“ both big and small, explicit and implicit.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2033-2037</sup></p>

* To make a promise is to declare yourself willing to be held accountable for ensuring that what you say you will do will actually be done. And if it isnâ€™t done, the guilt will remind you of your failure. Guilt and blame are the psychological responses to broken promises, and require a memory of past sins. If we donâ€™t know our past, we canâ€™t feel guilt and act morally.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2037-2041</sup></p>

* Living up to our obligations is not just a chore, but a manifestation of what is important in life â€“ and, basically, of who you are. In this context, dwelling on the past is essential.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2044-2045</sup></p>

* Our past â€“ both personal and cultural â€“ isnâ€™t a ready-made story that you can take in all at once.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2045-2046</sup></p>

* We are inextricably woven into events and relationships in ways that mean we donâ€™t always understand them. However, it is nonetheless crucial (especially on moral grounds) to draw links between our past, present and future, and not merely be content with being â€˜fully present in the momentâ€™.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2046-2048</sup></p>

* Dwelling on the past provides insights into the complexity of your life and how it is intertwined with all sorts of social and historical processes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2049-2051</sup></p>

* One is to seek out existing communities that are determined by the past. It is difficult for an individual to do something that goes against the zeitgeist, so it may prove helpful to seek out like-minded individuals. If you canâ€™t find any, youâ€™ll have to do the work yourself

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2054-2057</sup></p>

* It is when we participate in such traditions â€“ in family life, education, work, art, sports etc. â€“ that we become people. We only understand ourselves when we know the traditions from which we stem and within which we live our lives.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2068-2070</sup></p>

* without traditions and their history, nothing is meaningful.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2070-2071</sup></p>

* You must therefore dwell on the past to understand yourself as a cultural and historical being or entity. Only then will you find something on which to stand firm.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2071-2074</sup></p>

* According to the Stoic Seneca, those who are excessively busy do not contemplate the past: â€˜The engrossed, therefore, are concerned with present time alone, and it is so brief that it cannot be grasped, and even this is filched away from them, distracted as they are among many thingsâ€™,

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2074-2076</sup></p>

* If you want to be everywhere at once, you canâ€™t stand firm anywhere.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2076-2076</sup></p>

* â€˜The mind that is untroubled and tranquil has the power to roam into all the parts of its life; but the minds of the engrossed, just as if weighted by a yoke, cannot turn and look behind. And so their life vanishes into an abyss.â€™

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2077-2078</sup></p>

* It is therefore important to dwell on your own past, but also on the past of the culture in which you are embedded. And it would be even better if you were to practise living traditions.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2081-2082</sup></p>

* To practise living traditions is to be reminded of the historical depth of our lives. In this way, you learn that everything doesnâ€™t necessarily always move forwards.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2084-2085</sup></p>

* Look for role models who have put down roots. Insist on the right to stand still.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2094-2094</sup></p>

* it may serve as a useful corrective to the opposite dogma: that something is necessarily good because itâ€™s new.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2096-2096</sup></p>

* Parenting is a living tradition. Good parents (your own perhaps?) can serve as existential role models who are firmly â€˜rootedâ€™. Itâ€™s difficult to imagine anything more important than a binding relationship with individuals (children) for whom you have responsibility. When it comes to responsibility towards other people, stability is more important than mobility.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2102-2106</sup></p>

* One of the starting points for this book is that the problems associated with life have changed in the past half-century. The basic problem used to be that life was overly rigid â€“ stability was lauded over mobility. Now, it is overly flexible.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2137-2139</sup></p>

* Previously, our problem was wanting too much. Now it is that we will never be able to do enough in a society that constantly demands we do more and more and more.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2142-2144</sup></p>

* the Cynics were preoccupied with liberating themselves from dependence on the material world, with all its luxury and status symbols. They wandered the land in a self-imposed state of poverty and asceticism.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2221-2222</sup></p>

* Zeno â€“ and later Stoics â€“ didnâ€™t renounce the good things in life, they just pointed out the value of being prepared to lose them one day. The idea was that thereâ€™s nothing wrong with good food and a comfortable home per se, as long as you donâ€™t become dependent on them.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2229-2231</sup></p>

* A good life is the ultimate purpose of Zenoâ€™s Stoicism (as well as the later Stoics). However, the term â€˜the good lifeâ€™ had a completely different meaning back then. Today, the concept is usually associated with a form of hedonism, a philosophy of desires, a life of positive, exciting and varied experiences. For the Greek Stoics, the good life â€“ eudaimonia in Greek â€“ was far more about living a virtuous life, in accordance with ethics. It is by living life in this way that people flourish, in the true sense, and realise their humanity.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2235-2240</sup></p>

* For the Stoics, â€˜virtueâ€™ didnâ€™t relate to sexual mores (as it does nowadays when people bandy about archaic terms like â€˜a virtuous womanâ€™). Rather, the virtues consisted of the characteristics that enabled people to live in harmony with their own nature.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2240-2242</sup></p>

* the Stoics followed Plato and Aristotle, and determined that the function of humankind is to use our reason. Their thinking was based on the belief that no other living creature possesses anything like human reason. We are capable of thinking and speaking, reasoning logically and drawing up principles (laws) for social intercourse. This puts distance between us and our biological urges, and to some extent suppresses them.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2244-2248</sup></p>

* However, through practising the virtues, you master your urges and may even become a Stoic sage and serve as an example to others.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2249-2250</sup></p>

* You arenâ€™t blinded by egotistical emotions or instincts. Reason is thus both theoretical (e.g. as used in disciplines like logic or astronomy) and practical (i.e. oriented towards the good life, both individually and collectively).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2251-2252</sup></p>

* Modern, mechanical natural science rejects the Greek idea of purpose, meaning and value in nature. Instead, nature is seen as a mechanical system that functions according to certain principles of cause and effect, as formulated in the laws of nature.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2270-2272</sup></p>

* this is where we find the natural-science breakthrough that â€“ to quote sociologist Max Weberâ€™s famous phrase â€“ â€˜disenchants the worldâ€™ while â€˜re-enchantingâ€™ the human mind. It is here that we, in our era of modernity, should seek the essential aspects of life, i.e. ethics and values. However, there is also a price to pay â€“ these aspects are subjective and lean towards the psychological, which leads to the idea of the importance of what is inside you and the religion of the self, as I have called it in this book.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2275-2278</sup></p>

* When the â€˜outer worldâ€™, as a purely mechanical system, is unable to provide answers to lifeâ€™s big questions, we have to sanctify the â€˜inner worldâ€™.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2278-2280</sup></p>

* Stoicism affords us an opportunity to â€˜re-enchantâ€™ the world (and not just the mysterious â€˜inner worldâ€™), and as such obviates the need to frantically search within ourselves for answers.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2281-2282</sup></p>

* If a modern reader were to ask Seneca how to get the most out of this short life, the answer would not be to experience as much as possible, but to live a serene life with peace of mind and your negative emotions under control.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2305-2307</sup></p>

* Senecaâ€™s writings reflect an approach to humanity reminiscent of the one preached, almost contemporaneously, by Jesus of Nazareth. It is therefore no surprise that his thoughts have often been compared with the tenets of Christianity (albeit without the latterâ€™s metaphysical aspects). For example, Seneca wrote, â€˜To avoid anger with individuals, you must forgive the whole group, you must pardon the human race.â€™4

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2307-2311</sup></p>

* As with the other Stoics, he advocated living with peace of mind and dignity, even in times of adversity. This could be achieved by striving to live a life based on reason, the essential element of human nature. For example, Epictetus applied reason to distinguishing between that which it is possible to control and that which it is not.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2318-2321</sup></p>

* In essence, you should prepare for the uncontrollable (e.g. the weather, economic fluctuations, your own mortality), but itâ€™s a waste of time to worry about it or fear it. You should train yourself to take an active approach to the things you can do something about (e.g. becoming a more generous human being). All that it takes to distinguish one from the other is a dose of reason.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2321-2324</sup></p>

* The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that Marcus remained unchanged from his earliest days in politics (when he was an advisor to Antoninus Pius until the death of the latter). In other words, he stood firm on his integrity and consistently navigated through life on the basis of his ideas of good and evil.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2328-2330</sup></p>

* Ciceroâ€™s main themes are the good life and the good death, but he was also concerned with the public good. His masterpiece is perhaps De Officiis (On Duties), in which he asks â€“ based on Aristotleâ€™s conception of man as a rational political animal â€“ what duties are specifically associated with being human.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2337-2339</sup></p>

* If you would like to gain an insight into some of the best political writing in history, I recommend On Living and Dying Well â€“ a collection of letters and speeches in which Cicero address themes including fear of death, friendship and duties.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2340-2342</sup></p>

* In modern times, one of the most insightful analyses of Stoicism as a practical philosophy was written by the historian of philosophy Pierre Hadot.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2343-2344</sup></p>

* He sought to summarise the main ideas of Stoicism in its many different forms, and ultimately arrived at four key points: (1) the Stoic consciousness of the fact that no being is alone â€“ we are all a part of a larger whole (the cosmos); (2) all evil is moral evil, and therefore pure moral consciousness is important; (3) the belief in the absolute value of the human person (out of which originates the idea of human rights); and (4) a focus on the present moment (living as if we were seeing the world for the first and last time).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2344-2349</sup></p>

* In many ways, the first three points encapsulate the bookâ€™s view of humanity â€“ with a focus on humans as relational and moral beings with intrinsic value.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2350-2351</sup></p>

* I donâ€™t believe that humankind mainly lives in the moment, but in time as an extensive and continuous structure. This focus on the present, and on the individualâ€™s power to determine how they will be affected by what is happening right now, closely resembles the current self-development wave (â€˜you can choose to be happy now!â€™). In my view, this gives the individual too great a responsibility for how he or she meets the world. I donâ€™t believe that we can freely choose how we will be affected by the present.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2352-2356</sup></p>

* I donâ€™t believe that we can freely choose how we will be affected by the present.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2355-2356</sup></p>

* We are, to a far greater extent than the Stoics would accept, impotent â€“ indeed, the realisation of this can act as a source of solidarity between people.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2356-2358</sup></p>

* While this book does not mount an uncritical defence of Stoic philosophy, I believe that â€“ for those who find the coercive development wave, with its rudderless mania of development for its own sake, discomfiting â€“ it is uplifting to discover that, more than 2,000 years ago, thinkers had already developed a fruitful and thoughtful philosophy that teaches you how to stand firm.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2358-2361</sup></p>

* Simply being aware of this and similar traditions will better prepare you for life in the accelerating culture. You will derive comfort from the fact that there is an alternative to the pursuit of eternal positivity, self-development and authenticity â€“ an alternative which stresses that the finest things about human beings are our sense of duty, peace of mind and dignity.
