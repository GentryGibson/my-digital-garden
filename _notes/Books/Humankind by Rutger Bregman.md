## 📔 Book Report
---
### 🚀 Summary
The book's core message is this: humans do not turn into savages when crisis hits. Instead, they become the best version of themselves and help one another.

### 🎨 Impressions
I have some mixed thoughts about this book. It is well-written and entertaining but I am half-convinced of the author's message. 

I do like how the author debunks many of the stories that exemplify the Veneer Theory.


### ☘ How the Book Changed Me
In some way, the book made me a little less cynical. When the author equated being cynical with being lazy and not taking responsibility, it felt like I found a some sort of missing link. "Are there some examples to support that claim?" I said to myself as I read that passage.




### ✍️ My Top 3 Quotes
- In a weird way, to believe in our own sinful nature is comforting. It provides a kind of absolution. Because if most people are bad, then engagement and resistance aren’t worth the effort.
- Never let yourself be diverted by what you wish to believe.
- Cynicism is just another word for laziness. It’s an excuse not to take responsibility. Because if you believe most people are rotten, you don’t need to get worked up about injustice. The world is going to hell either way.



## 📑 Kindle Highlights

* There is a persistent myth that by their very nature humans are selfish, aggressive and quick to panic. It’s what Dutch biologist Frans de Waal likes to call veneer theory: the notion that civilisation is nothing more than a thin veneer that will crack at the merest provocation.4 In actuality, the opposite is true. It’s when crisis hits – when the bombs fall or the floodwaters rise – that we humans become our best selves.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 231-234</sup></p>

* that elite panic comes from powerful people who see all humanity in their own image.’ Dictators and despots, governors and generals – they all too often resort to brute force to prevent scenarios that exist only in their own heads, on the assumption that the average Joe is ruled by self-interest, just like them.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 276-278</sup></p>

* If we believe most people can’t be trusted, that’s how we’ll treat each other, to everyone’s detriment. Few ideas have as much power to shape the world as our view of other people. Because ultimately, you get what you expect to get. If we want to tackle the greatest challenges of our times – from the climate crisis to our growing distrust of one another – then I think the place we need to start is our view of human nature.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 317-320</sup></p>


* An old man says to his grandson: ‘There’s a fight going on inside me. It’s a terrible fight between two wolves. One is evil – angry, greedy, jealous, arrogant, and cowardly. The other is good – peaceful, loving, modest, generous, honest, and trustworthy. These two wolves are also fighting within you, and inside every other person too.’ After a moment, the boy asks, ‘Which wolf will win?’ The old man smiles. ‘The one you feed.’

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 326-333</sup></p>

* The news, according to dozens of studies, is a mental health hazard.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 370-371</sup></p>

* Ever since the birth of that cursed civil society, Rousseau argued, things had gone wrong. Farming, urbanisation, statehood – they hadn’t lifted us out of chaos, but enslaved and doomed us. The invention of writing and the printing press had only made matters worse. ‘Thanks to typographic characters,’ he wrote, ‘the dangerous reveries of Hobbes […] will remain for ever.’

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 781-784</sup></p>

* Some theologists even suspect that the story of the Fall alludes to the shift to organised agriculture, as starkly characterised by Genesis 3: ‘By the sweat of your brow you shall eat bread.’28

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1526-1528</sup></p>

* The real story of Easter Island is the story of a resourceful and resilient people, of persistence in the face of long odds. It’s not a tale of impending doom, but a wellspring of hope.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1980-1982</sup></p>

* In other words, if you push people hard enough, if you poke and prod, bait and manipulate, many of us are indeed capable of doing evil. The road to hell is paved with good intentions. But evil doesn’t live just beneath the surface; it takes immense effort to draw it out. And most importantly, evil has to be disguised as doing good.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2409-2412</sup></p>

* Eichmann was a prime example. He’d convinced himself he’d done a great deed, something historic for which he’d be admired by future generations. That didn’t make him a monster or a robot. It made him a joiner. Many years later, psychologists would reach the same conclusion about Milgram’s research: the shock experiments were not about obedience. They were about conformity.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2470-2473</sup></p>

* (that humans are tempted by evil masquerading as good).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2475-2475</sup></p>

* In a weird way, to believe in our own sinful nature is comforting. It provides a kind of absolution. Because if most people are bad, then engagement and resistance aren’t worth the effort.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2481-2482</sup></p>

* In 2015, psychologist Matthew Hollander reviewed the taped recordings of 117 sessions at Milgram’s shock machine. After extensive analysis, he discovered a pattern. The subjects who managed to halt the experiment used three tactics: 1. Talk to the victim. 2. Remind the man in the grey lab coat of his responsibility. 3. Repeatedly refuse to continue.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2481-2492</sup></p>

* Belief in humankind’s sinful nature also provides a tidy explanation for the existence of evil. When confronted with hatred or selfishness, you can tell yourself, ‘Oh, well, that’s just human nature.’ But if you believe that people are essentially good, you have to question why evil exists at all. It implies that engagement and resistance are worthwhile, and it imposes an obligation to act.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2482-2485</sup></p>

* Communication and confrontation, compassion and resistance. Hollander discovered that virtually all participants used these tactics – virtually all wanted to stop, after all – but that those who succeeded used them much more. The good news is: these are trainable skills. Resistance just takes practice. ‘What distinguishes Milgram’s heroes,’ Hollander observes, ‘is largely a teachable competency at resisting questionable authority.’

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2492-2495</sup></p>

* This is the real story of Kitty Genovese. It’s a story that ought to be required reading not only for first-year psychology students, but also for aspiring journalists. That’s because it teaches us three things. One, how out of whack our view of human nature often is. Two, how deftly journalists push those buttons to sell sensational stories. And, last but not least, how it’s precisely in emergencies that we can count on one another.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2751-2754</sup></p>

* ‘The mechanism that makes us the kindest species also makes us the cruelest species on the planet.’

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2778-2779</sup></p>

* From the outset of the war, most psychologists firmly believed that one factor outweighed every other in determining an army’s fighting power. Ideology. Love of one’s country, for example, or faith in one’s chosen party. The soldiers who were most thoroughly convinced they stood on the right side of history and that theirs was the legitimate worldview would – so the thinking went – put up the best fight.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2817-2820</sup></p>

* ‘Terrorists don’t kill and die just for a cause,’ one American anthropologist notes. ‘They kill and die for each other.’

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2891-2892</sup></p>

* Even when people try to treat everyone as equals and act as though variations in skin colour, appearance, or wealth don’t exist, children still perceive the difference. It seems we’re born with a button for tribalism in our brains. All that’s needed is for something to switch it on.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2982-2984</sup></p>

* empathy isn’t a beneficent sun illuminating the world. It’s a spotlight. A searchlight. It singles out a specific person or group of people in your life, and while you’re busy sucking up all the emotions bathed in that one ray of light, the rest of the world fades away.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3001-3003</sup></p>

* As I read Bloom’s book, I began to realise that empathy resembles nothing so much as that modern-day phenomenon: the news. In Chapter 1, we saw that the news also functions like a spotlight. Just as empathy misleads us by zooming in on the specific, the news deceives us by zooming in on the exceptional.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3019-3022</sup></p>

* One thing is certain: a better world doesn’t start with more empathy. If anything, empathy makes us less forgiving, because the more we identify with victims, the more we generalise about our enemies. The bright spotlight we shine on our chosen few makes us blind to the perspective of our adversaries, because everybody else falls outside our view.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3022-3025</sup></p>

* The big advantage of Niccolò Machiavelli’s philosophy is that it’s doable. If you want power, he wrote, you have to grab it. You must be shameless, unfettered by principles or morals. The ends justify the means. And if you don’t look out for yourself, people will waltz right over you. According to Machiavelli, ‘it can be said about men in general that they are ungrateful, fickle, dissembling, hypocritical, cowardly, and greedy’. If someone does you a good turn, don’t be fooled: it’s a sham, for ‘men never do anything good except out of necessity’.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3104-3109</sup></p>

* The medical term is ‘acquired sociopathy’: a non-hereditary antisocial personality disorder, first diagnosed by psychologists in the nineteenth century. It arises after a blow to the head that damages key regions of the brain and can turn the nicest people into the worst kind of Machiavellian. It transpires that people in power display the same tendencies.10 They literally act like someone with brain damage. Not only are they more impulsive, self-centred, reckless, arrogant and rude than average, they are more likely to cheat on their spouses, are less attentive to other people and less interested in others’ perspectives. They’re also more shameless, often failing to manifest that one facial phenomenon that makes human beings unique among primates. They don’t blush.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3141-3148</sup></p>

* One of the effects of power, myriad studies show, is that it makes you see others in a negative light.13 If you’re powerful you’re more likely to think most people are lazy and unreliable. That they need to be supervised and monitored, managed and regulated, censored and told what to do. And because power makes you feel superior to other people, you’ll believe all this monitoring should be entrusted to you.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3154-3158</sup></p>

* power is like a drug – one with a whole catalogue of side effects. ‘Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,’ British historian Lord Acton famously remarked back in the nineteenth century. There are few statements on which psychologists, sociologists and historians so unanimously agree.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3172-3175</sup></p>

* Dacher Keltner calls this ‘the power paradox’. Scores of studies show that we pick the most modest and kind-hearted individuals to lead us. But once they arrive at the top, the power often goes straight to their heads – and good luck unseating them after that.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3176-3178</sup></p>

* In capitalist societies, we tend to use arguments of merit. But how does society decide who has the most merit? How do you determine who contributes most to society? Bankers or bin men? Nurses or the so-called disruptors who’re always thinking outside the box? The better the story you spin about yourself, the bigger your piece of the pie.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3222-3224</sup></p>

* In fact, you could look at the entire evolution of civilisation as a history of rulers who continually devised new justifications for their privileges.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3224-3225</sup></p>

* Typically, our social circles number no more than about one hundred and fifty people. Scientists arrived at this limit in the 1990s, when two American researchers asked a group of volunteers to list all the friends and family to whom they sent Christmas cards. The average was sixty-eight households, comprising some one hundred and fifty individuals.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3231-3233</sup></p>

* When we began living together in large groups alongside thousands of strangers, everything changed. Quite literally, we lost sight of each other. There’s no way you can make eye contact with thousands or tens of thousands or a million people, so our mutual distrust began to grow. Increasingly, people started to suspect others of sponging off the community; that while they were breaking their backs all those others were putting their feet up. And so rulers needed someone to keep tabs on the masses. Someone who heard everything and saw everything. An all-seeing Eye. God. It’s no accident that the new deities were vengeful types. God became a super-Leviathan, spying on everyone twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Not even your thoughts were safe. ‘Even the hairs of your head are all numbered,’ the Bible tells us in Matthew 10:30. It was this omniscient being that from now on kept watch from the heavens, supervising, surveilling and – when necessary – striking.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3248-3256</sup></p>

* Myths were key to helping the human race and our leaders do something no other species had done before. They enabled us to work together on a massive scale with millions of strangers. Furthermore, this theory goes on to say, it was from these great powers of fabrication that great civilisations arose. Judaism and Islam, nationalism and capitalism – all are products of our imagination. ‘It all revolved around telling stories,’ Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari writes in his book Sapiens (2011), ‘and convincing people to believe them.’

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3256-3260</sup></p>

* The reason is self-evident. If you ignore a bill or don’t pay your taxes, you’ll be fined or locked up. If you don’t willingly comply, the authorities will come after you. Money may be a fiction, but it’s enforced by the threat of very real violence.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3291-3294</sup></p>

* Sociologists call this the ‘iron law of oligarchy’: even socialists and communists, for all their vaunted ideals of liberty and equality, are far from immune to the corrupting influence of too much power.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3308-3310</sup></p>

* Rousseau already observed that this form of government is more accurately an ‘elective aristocracy’ because in practice the people are not in power at all. Instead we’re allowed to decide who holds power over us. It’s also important to realise this model was originally designed to exclude society’s rank and file. Take the American Constitution: historians agree it ‘was intrinsically an aristocratic document designed to check the democratic tendencies of the period’. It was never the American Founding Fathers’ intention for the general populace to play an active role in politics. Even now, though any citizen can run for public office, it’s tough to win an election without access to an aristocratic network of donors and lobbyists. It’s not surprising that American ‘democracy’ exhibits dynastic tendencies – think of the Kennedys, the Clintons, the Bushes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3312-3319</sup></p>

* For millennia, shaming was the surest way to tame our leaders, and it can still work today. Shame is more effective than rules and regulations or censure and coercion, because people who feel shame regulate themselves. In the way their speech falters when they disappoint expectations or in a telltale flush when they realise they’re the subject of gossip.36 Clearly, shame also has a dark side (shame induced by poverty, for example), but try to imagine what society would be like if shame didn’t exist. That would be hell.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3324-3328</sup></p>

* ‘It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their humanity, but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages.’

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3393-3395</sup></p>

* The role of God the father was to be supplanted by faith in the state. In the wake of the Enlightenment, religion consequently adopted a much friendlier demeanour.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3411-3412</sup></p>

* Can it be a coincidence that the largest concentrations of atheists are to be found in countries like Denmark or Sweden? These nations also have the most robust rule of law and most trustworthy bureaucracies. In countries like these, religion has been displaced. Much as mass production once sidelined traditional craftspeople, God lost his job to bureaucrats.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3414-3417</sup></p>

* Historians point out that if the Enlightenment gave us equality, it also invented racism.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3429-3430</sup></p>


* Modern capitalism, democracy and the rule of law are all founded on the principle that people are selfish. But if you actually read their books you come to realise that Enlightenment authors were not diehard cynics at all. Seventeen years before publishing The Wealth of Nations (destined to become the capitalist bible), Adam Smith wrote a volume titled The Theory of Moral Sentiments. In it, we find passages like this one: How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3439-3446</sup></p>


* some things can become true merely because we believe in them – that pessimism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When modern economists assumed that people are innately selfish, they advocated policies that fostered self-serving behaviour. When politicians convinced themselves that politics is a cynical game, that’s exactly what it became.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3454-3457</sup></p>

* When you are studying any matter or considering any philosophy, ask yourself only what are the facts and what is the truth that the facts bear out. Never let yourself be diverted either by what you wish to believe or by what you think would have beneficent social effects if it were believed, but look only and solely at what are the facts.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3475-3478</sup></p>

* ‘Never let yourself be diverted by what you wish to believe.’

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3481-3482</sup></p>

* some things just have to be taken on faith, even if we can’t prove they’re true.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3491-3492</sup></p>

* Take friendship. If you go around for ever doubting other people, you’ll behave in ways guaranteed to make you disliked. Things like friendship, love, trust and loyalty become true precisely because we believe in them. While James allowed that one’s belief could be proved wrong, he argued that ‘dupery through hope’ was preferable to ‘dupery through fear’.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3492-3495</sup></p>

* Beliefs we’re devoted to – whether they’re true or imagined – can likewise come to life, effecting very real change in the world. The Pygmalion Effect resembles the placebo effect (which I discussed in Chapter 1), except, instead of benefiting oneself, these are expectations that benefit others.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3525-3527</sup></p>

* The Golem Effect is a kind of nocebo: a nocebo that causes poor pupils to fall further behind, the homeless to lose hope and isolated teenagers to radicalise. It’s also one of the insidious mechanisms behind racism, because when you’re subjected to low expectations, you won’t perform at your best, which further diminishes others’ expectations and thus further undermines your performance.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3547-3549</sup></p>

* pluralistic ignorance can be disastrous – even fatal. Consider binge drinking. Survey college students on their own, and most will say drinking themselves into oblivion isn’t their favourite pastime. But because they assume other students are big fans of drinking, they try to keep up and everyone winds up puking in the gutter.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3580-3582</sup></p>

* ‘The gap between the people at the top and the folks doing the actual work – in healthcare, in education, you name it – is enormous,’ De Blok tells me when I visit his office in Almelo. ‘Managers tend to band together. They set up all kinds of courses and conferences where they tell each other they’re doing things right.’

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3728-3730</sup></p>

* Edward Deci, the American psychologist who flipped the script on how we think about motivation, thought the question should no longer be how to motivate others, but how we shape a society so that people motivate themselves. This question is neither conservative nor progressive, neither capitalist nor communist. It speaks to a new movement – a new realism. Because nothing is more powerful than people who do something because they want to do it.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3814-3817</sup></p>


* ‘School is the advertising agency which makes you believe that you need the society as it is.’39

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4038-4040</sup></p>

* ‘The opposite of play is not work,’ the psychologist Brian Sutton-Smith once said. ‘The opposite of play is depression.’

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4045-4047</sup></p>

* As a child, this sounded like a great idea. Why not share everything? But in the years that followed, like so many kids I had to face a disappointing realisation: sharing everything equally may be a fine idea, in practice it degenerates into chaos, poverty, or worse – a bloodbath. Look at Russia under Lenin and Stalin. China under Mao. Cambodia under Pol Pot.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4195-4197</sup></p>

* Simple example: you’re sitting at the dinner table and can’t reach the salt. You say, ‘Please pass the salt’ and, just like that, someone hands you the salt – for free. Humans are crazy about this kind of everyday communism, as anthropologists call it, sharing our parks and plazas, our music and stories, our beaches and beds.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4205-4208</sup></p>



* People there managed to keep a cool head even after the most horrific attack in the country’s history. After the 2011 bloodbath perpetrated by right-wing extremist Anders Breivik, the country’s prime minister declared, ‘Our response is more democracy, more openness, and more humanity.’ This kind of response often gets you accused of looking the other way, of choosing the easy path. But more democracy, more openness and more humanity are precisely what’s not easy. On the contrary, tough talk, retaliation, shutting down borders, dropping bombs, dividing up the world into the good guys and the bad – that’s easy. That’s looking the other way.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4668-4673</sup></p>

* For every unpleasant incident we encounter, there are any number of pleasant interactions. The bad may seem stronger, but it’s outnumbered by the good.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4865-4867</sup></p>

* ‘If you talk to a man in a language he understands,’ Mandela explained, ‘that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his language, that goes to his heart.’

* When we hole up in our own trenches, we lose sight of reality. We’re lured into thinking that a small, hate-mongering minority reflects all humankind.

* I: When in doubt, assume the best

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5144-5145</sup></p>

* negativity bias. A single unpleasant remark makes a deeper impression than ten compliments combined (the bad may seem stronger, but it’s outnumbered by the good.). And when in doubt, we’re inclined to assume the worst.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5150-5152</sup></p>

* II: Think in win-win scenarios

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5169-5169</sup></p>

* It’s not only a gift, but a good deal, because to forgive is to stop wasting your energy on antipathy and grudges. Effectively, you liberate yourself to live. ‘To forgive is to set a prisoner free,’ wrote the theologist Lewis B. Smedes, ‘and discover that the prisoner was you.’

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5185-5187</sup></p>


* III: Ask more questions

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5188-5188</sup></p>

* All those managers, CEOs, journalists and policymakers who think they do are effectively robbing others of their voice. This is why you so seldom see refugees interviewed on TV. This is why our democracy and journalism constitute mostly one-way traffic. And this is why our welfare states are steeped in paternalism.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5197-5199</sup></p>


* ‘Platinum Rule’, was nicely summed up by George Bernard Shaw. ‘Do not do unto others as you would that they should do unto you,’ he advised. ‘Their tastes may be different.’

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5203-5204</sup></p>

* IV: Temper your empathy, train your compassion

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5205-5205</sup></p>

* unlike empathy, compassion doesn’t sap our energy. In fact, afterwards Ricard felt much better. That’s because compassion is simultaneously more controlled, remote and constructive. It’s not about sharing another person’s distress, but it does help you to recognise it and then act. Not only that, compassion injects us with energy, which is exactly what’s needed to help.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5223-5226</sup></p>

* To give another example, let’s say your child is afraid of the dark. As a parent, you’re not going to crouch in a corner of the room and whimper alongside your son or daughter (empathy). Rather, you try to calm and comfort them (compassion).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5226-5228</sup></p>

* V: Try to understand the other, even if you don’t get where they’re coming from

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5231-5232</sup></p>

* Understanding the other at a rational level is a skill. It’s a muscle you can train.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5248-5249</sup></p>

* Where we need our capacity for reason most of all is to suppress, from time to time, our desire to be nice. Sometimes our sociable instinct gets in the way of truth and of equity.

* VI: Love your own as others love their own

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5257-5257</sup></p>

* evil does its work from a distance. Distance lets us rant at strangers on the internet. Distance helps soldiers bypass their aversion to violence. And distance has enabled the most horrifying crimes in history, from slavery to the Holocaust.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5276-5278</sup></p>

* VII: Avoid the news

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5287-5288</sup></p>

* Watching the evening news may leave you feeling more attuned to reality, but the truth is that it skews your view of the world.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5288-5289</sup></p>

* steer clear of television news and push notifications and instead read a more nuanced Sunday paper and in-depth feature writing, whether online or off. Disengage from your screen and meet real people in the flesh. Think as carefully about what information you feed your mind as you do about the food you feed your body.

* cynicism is just another word for laziness. It’s an excuse not to take responsibility. Because if you believe most people are rotten, you don’t need to get worked up about injustice. The world is going to hell either way.

* IX. Come out of the closet: don’t be ashamed to do good

* ‘When you give to the needy, sound no trumpet …’ Jesus warned during the Sermon on the Mount, and ‘when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret’.

* Modern psychologists have discovered that when people do something out of the goodness of their hearts, they often fabricate selfish motives. This is most prevalent in individualistic Western cultures where veneer theory is most entrenched.

* emotion ‘elevation’. People are wired so that a simple sign of kindness literally makes us feel warm and tingly. And what’s fascinating is that this effect occurs even when we hear these stories from someone else. It’s as though we press a mental reset button that wipes away our cynical feelings so we once more have a clear view of the world.

* X. Be realistic

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 5365-5366</sup></p>

* In truth, it’s the cynic who’s out of touch. In truth, we’re living on Planet A, where people are deeply inclined to be good to one another. So be realistic. Be courageous. Be true to your nature and offer your trust. Do good in broad daylight, and don’t be ashamed of your generosity. You may be dismissed as gullible and naive at first. But remember, what’s naive today may be common sense tomorrow. It’s time for a new realism. It’s time for a new view of humankind.
