## üìî Book Report
---
### üöÄ Summary
This is a book about navigating the confusing world of the so-called "twenty-something". It argues that your twentysomething years matter despite how the popular culture depicts that age.

### üé® Impressions
This is a good book for those who are about to graduate and on their way to the "real world". It will also change how you will perceive popular culture after reading this book.

### ‚òò How the Book Changed Me
I read this book a month after I graduated from college (2018) and I thought that was the right time to read this book. 

I think everyone has probably experienced the feeling of getting lost or felt like they don't know how to navigate the "real world" after graduation. This book was like the compass that I used to navigate through troubled waters.

Four years later, I reread it again just to get my bearings and get the highlights from Kindle.

### ‚úçÔ∏è My Top 3 Quotes
- [[The unlived life is not worth examining.]]
- Life stories with themes of ruin can trap us. Life stories that are triumphant can transform us.
- There is a big difference between having a life in your thirties and starting a life in your thirties.

* Researchers in this same study found that most of the substantial and lasting events‚Äîthose that led to career success, family fortune, personal bliss, or lack thereof‚Äîdeveloped across days or weeks or months with little immediate dramatic effect.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 35-37</sup></p>

* ‚ÄúThe unlived life is not worth examining.‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 75-75</sup></p>

* We are led to believe the twentysomething years don‚Äôt matter, yet, with the glamorization of and near obsession with the twenties, there is little to remind us that anything else ever will. This causes too many men and women to squander the most transformative years of their adult lives, only to pay the price in decades to come.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 119-122</sup></p>

* Our cultural attitude toward the twenties is something like good old American irrational exuberance. Twenty-first-century twentysomethings have grown up alongside the dot-com craze, the supersize years, the housing bubble, and the Wall Street boom.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 122-124</sup></p>


* Adults of all ages let what psychologists call ‚Äúunrealistic optimism‚Äù‚Äîthe idea that nothing bad will ever happen to you‚Äîovertake logic and reason. Adults of all backgrounds failed to do the math. Now twentysomethings have been set up to be another bubble ready to burst.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 125-127</sup></p>

* Many entry-level jobs have gone overseas making it more difficult for twentysomethings to gain a foothold at home. With a contracting economy and a growing population, unemployment is at its highest in decades. An unpaid internship is the new starter job. About a quarter of twentysomethings are out of work and another quarter work only part-time. Twentysomethings who do have paying jobs earn less than their 1970s counterparts when adjusted for inflation.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 129-135</sup></p>

* It seems everybody wants to be a twentysomething except for many twentysomethings themselves. All around, ‚Äúthirty is the new twenty‚Äù is starting to get a new reaction: ‚ÄúGod, I hope not.‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 140-142</sup></p>



* Uncertainty makes people anxious, and distraction is the twenty-first-century opiate of the masses. So twentysomethings like Kate are tempted, and even encouraged, to turn away and be twixters, to close their eyes and hope for the best.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 157-159</sup></p>

* There is a saying that ‚Äúhope is a good breakfast but a bad supper.‚Äù While hopefulness is a useful state of mind that may help many downtrodden twentysomethings get out of bed in the morning, at the end of the day they need more than optimism because at the end of their twenties many will want more than diversions and record collections.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 163-166</sup></p>

* We think that by avoiding decisions now, we keep all of our options open for later‚Äîbut not making choices is a choice all the same.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 171-173</sup></p>

* The postmillennial midlife crisis is figuring out that while we were busy making sure we didn‚Äôt miss out on anything, we were setting ourselves up to miss out on some of the most important things of all. It is realizing that doing something later is not automatically the same as doing something better. Too many smart, well-meaning thirtysomethings and fortysomethings grieve a little as they face a lifetime of catching up. They look at themselves‚Äîand at me sitting across the room‚Äîand say about their twenties, ‚ÄúWhat was I doing? What was I thinking?‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 184-189</sup></p>


* In almost all areas of development, there is what is called a critical period, a time when we are primed for growth and change, when simple exposure can lead to dramatic transformation. Children effortlessly learn whatever language they hear before the age of five. We develop binocular vision between three and eight months of age. These critical periods are windows of opportunity when learning happens quickly. Afterward, things are not so easy. The twenties are that critical period of adulthood.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 194-198</sup></p>

* an extended period of navel-gazing is usually counterproductive for twentysomethings.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 251-252</sup></p>

* Identity capital is our collection of personal assets. It is the repertoire of individual resources that we assemble over time. These are the investments we make in ourselves, the things we do well enough, or long enough, that they become a part of who we are.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 277-278</sup></p>

* Identity capital is how we build ourselves‚Äîbit by bit, over time. Most important, identity capital is what we bring to the adult marketplace. It is the currency we use to metaphorically purchase jobs and relationships and other things we want.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 280-282</sup></p>

* Erikson himself warned against spending too much time in ‚Äúdisengaged confusion.‚Äù He was concerned that too many young people were ‚Äúin danger of becoming irrelevant.‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 285-287</sup></p>

* Research on underemployed twentysomethings tells us that those who are underemployed for as little as nine months tend to be more depressed and less motivated than their peers‚Äîthan even their unemployed peers. But before we decide that unemployment is a better alternative to underemployment, consider this: Twentysomething unemployment is associated with heavy drinking and depression in middle age even after becoming regularly employed.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 347-352</sup></p>

* The urban tribe may bring us soup when we are sick, but it is the people we hardly know‚Äîthose who never make it into our tribe‚Äîwho will swiftly and dramatically change our lives for the better.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 434-435</sup></p>

* Rose Coser, called the ‚Äúweakness of strong ties,‚Äù or how our close friends hold us back. Our strong ties feel comfortable and familiar but, other than support, they may have little to offer. They are usually too similar‚Äîeven too similarly stuck‚Äîto provide more than sympathy. They often don‚Äôt know any more about jobs or relationships than we do.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 453-456</sup></p>

* Weak ties feel too different or, in some cases, literally too far away to be close friends. But that‚Äôs the point. Because they‚Äôre not just figures in an already ingrown cluster, weak ties give us access to something fresh. They know things and people that we don‚Äôt know. Information and opportunity spread farther and faster through weak ties than through close friends because weak ties have fewer overlapping contacts. Weak ties are like bridges you cannot see all the way across, so there is no telling where they might lead.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 456-460</sup></p>

* ‚ÄúHe that hath once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged.‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 542-544</sup></p>

* There is a ‚Äúhelper‚Äôs high‚Äù that comes from being generous. In numerous studies, altruism has been linked to happiness, health, and longevity‚Äîas long as the help we give is not a burden.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 554-556</sup></p>

* Research shows that our social networks narrow across adulthood, as careers and families become busier and more defined. So‚Äîeven and especially as we job-hop and move cross-country and change roommates and spend our weekends about town‚Äîthis is the time to be connecting, not just with the same people having the same conversations about how work is lame or how there are no good men out there, but with those who might see things a little differently. Weak ties are the people who will better your life right now‚Äîand again and again in the years to come‚Äîif you have the courage to know what you want.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 578-583</sup></p>

* Twentysomethings like Ian were raised on abstract commands‚Äî‚ÄúFollow your dreams!‚Äù ‚ÄúReach for the stars!‚Äù‚Äîbut they often don‚Äôt know much about how to get these things done. They don‚Äôt know how to get what they want or, sometimes, even what they want.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 617-619</sup></p>

* the jam experiment. The jam experiment was conducted by a researcher named Sheena Iyengar who, then at Stanford University, had the idea that the local grocery store would be an excellent place to understand how people make choices.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 626-627</sup></p>

* The key finding in the study was that the twenty-four-flavor table attracted more attention yet it resulted in fewer buyers. Shoppers flocked to the exciting array, yet most became overwhelmed and dropped out of buying jam altogether. Only 3 percent of those who visited the twenty-four-flavor table went on to buy jam. In contrast, shoppers who visited the six-flavor table were more able to decide which jar was right for them, with about 30 percent leaving the store with jam in hand.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 631-634</sup></p>

* The lottery question might get you thinking about what you would do if talent and money didn‚Äôt matter. But they do. The question twentysomethings need to ask themselves is what they would do with their lives if they didn‚Äôt win the lottery. What might you be able to do well enough to support the life you want? And what might you enjoy enough that you won‚Äôt mind working at it in some form or another for years to come?‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 652-655</sup></p>

* Unthought knowns are those things we know about ourselves but forget somehow. These are the dreams we have lost sight of or the truths we sense but don‚Äôt say out loud. We may be afraid of acknowledging the unthought known to other people because we are afraid of what they might think. Even more often, we fear what the unthought known will then mean for ourselves and our lives.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 676-678</sup></p>

* ‚ÄúAnd these are supposed to be the best years of my life!‚Äù Talia implored. ‚ÄúThey are?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she said, this time seeming a bit unsure. ‚ÄúIn my experience, these are the most uncertain and some of the most difficult years of life.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy doesn‚Äôt anybody tell you that?!‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 712-715</sup></p>

* Some 90 percent of users say they use Facebook to stay in touch with longtime acquaintances, and 50 percent have found out something important about their friends this way. This can be especially helpful in our twenties because, as Talia noted, these are some of the most far-flung years of our lives. Facebook can help twentysomething life feel more coherent and less random.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 731-733</sup></p>

* Research tells us that, on average, Facebook users spend more time examining others‚Äô pages than adding content to their own. The site‚Äôs most frequent visitors‚Äîmost often females who post and share photos and who receive status updates‚Äîuse the site for ‚Äúsocial surveillance.‚Äù These social investigators usually aren‚Äôt getting in touch or staying in touch with friends as much as they are checking up on them. And my clients are right: Judging and evaluating are involved.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 735-739</sup></p>

* Rather than a way of catching up, Facebook can be one more way of keeping up. What‚Äôs worse is that now we feel the need to keep up not just with our closest friends and neighbors, but with hundreds of others whose manufactured updates continually remind us of how glorious life should be.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 745-748</sup></p>

* Part of realizing our potential is recognizing how our particular gifts and limitations fit with the world around us. We realize where our authentic potential actually lies.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 765-767</sup></p>

* Any search for glory is propelled by what Horney called the tyranny of the should. Listening to Talia talk, it was difficult not to notice the ‚Äúshoulds‚Äù and ‚Äúsupposed to‚Äôs‚Äù that littered her sentences: Work should be Wow! She should be in graduate school. Her life should look better than it did.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 772-774</sup></p>

* Shoulds can masquerade as high standards or lofty goals, but they are not the same. Goals direct us from the inside, but shoulds are paralyzing judgments from the outside. Goals feel like authentic dreams while shoulds feel like oppressive obligations. Shoulds set up a false dichotomy between either meeting an ideal or being a failure, between perfection or settling. The tyranny of the should even pits us against our own best interests.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 774-778</sup></p>

* Ian‚Äôs search for glory was the lure of being different, so he displayed what has been called a common symptom of youth: ‚Äúthe dread of doing what has been done before

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 877-879</sup></p>

* An identity or a career cannot be built around what you don‚Äôt want. We have to shift from a negative identity, or a sense of what I‚Äôm not, to a positive one, or a sense of what I am. This takes courage.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 886-888</sup></p>

* ‚ÄúBeing against something is easy,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat are you for?‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 889-890</sup></p>

* In business and culture, we have moved from mass production to mass customization. Progress used to mean turning out the most identical widgets at the least expense for the highest profit. Now we expect to be able to tailor goods and services to suit our wants and needs.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 923-925</sup></p>

* A custom shirt company encourages consumers to be their own brand. With e-commerce and peer-to-peer marketing we have set aside one-size-fits-all in favor of a ‚Äúmarket of one.‚Äù Companies and marketers have tapped into the innovative life that many, like Ian, want but are not sure how to get: ‚ÄúLet them eat lifestyle!‚Äù it is said.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 926-930</sup></p>

* The most important decision any of us make is who we marry. Yet there are no courses on how to choose a spouse. ‚ÄîDavid Brooks, political and cultural commentator

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1006-1008</sup></p>

* Many children of divorce said they had not much noticed‚Äîor cared‚Äîwhether their parents were happily married. What they did know was that their lives fell apart after their parents split, as resources and parents became stretched too thin. So while we hear a lot about twentysomethings who just want to have fun before marriage, many are also waiting to commit in hopes of being luckier in love than their parents were.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1056-1059</sup></p>

* The most recent studies show that marrying later than the teen years does indeed protect against divorce, but this only holds true until about age twenty-five. After twenty-five, one‚Äôs age at marriage does not predict divorce. These findings run counter to the notion that it is unquestionably better to postpone marriage as long as you can.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1074-1077</sup></p>

* Older spouses may be more mature, but later marriage has its own challenges. Rather than growing together while their twentysomething selves are still forming, partners who marry older may be more set in their ways. And a series of low-commitment, possibly destructive relationships can create bad habits and erode faith in love. And even though searching may help you find a better partner, the pool of available singles shallows over time, perhaps in more ways than one.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1077-1080</sup></p>

* The Age Thirty Deadline is the quiet but nagging concern that so many twentysomethings have. What to do about relationships in our twenties may not be clear‚Äîor even seem imminently important‚Äîbut ‚ÄúI‚Äôd better not be alone at thirty‚Äù is a common refrain.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1081-1084</sup></p>

* Marriage goes from being something we‚Äôll worry about at thirty to being something we want at thirty. When, then, is the time to really think about partnership? This sudden shift can lead to all kinds of trouble.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1088-1090</sup></p>

* So many of my twentysomething clients either don‚Äôt take their relationships seriously or don‚Äôt think they are allowed to. Then somewhere around thirty, getting married suddenly seems pressing.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1106-1107</sup></p>

* Often the clients with the toughest family backgrounds know the least about how to get what they want in love. But these are the clients who need to be the most careful. They are the very clients who need to partner well.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1201-1202</sup></p>

* There is something scary about picking your family. It‚Äôs not romantic. It means you aren‚Äôt just waiting for your soulmate to arrive. It means you know you are making decisions that will affect the rest of your life. It means you are thinking about the fact that your relationship needs to work not only in the here and now but also in the there and then.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1221-1224</sup></p>

* Twentysomethings who aren‚Äôt at least a little scared about their relationships are often the ones who are being the least thoughtful.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1224-1225</sup></p>

* Western culture is generally individualistic, prizing independence and self-fulfillment in almost all areas. We emphasize rights over duties and choice over obligation

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1231-1232</sup></p>


* Clients like Emma feel destined for unhappiness because of broken families. They grew up believing that family was beyond their control, or something other people got to have.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1236-1237</sup></p>

* What no one tells twentysomethings like Emma is that finally, and suddenly, they can pick their own families‚Äîthey can create their own families‚Äîand these are the families that life will be about.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1238-1239</sup></p>

* couples who ‚Äúlive together first‚Äù are actually less satisfied with their marriages and more likely to divorce than couples who do not. This is what sociologists call the cohabitation effect.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1279-1281</sup></p>

* Like many twentysomethings who cohabitate, Jennifer and Carter‚Äôs life together sounded more like an intersection between college roommate and sex partner than a lifelong commitment between two spouses. They vaguely had the idea of testing their relationship, but they didn‚Äôt venture into areas that typically stress a marriage: They didn‚Äôt pay a mortgage, try to get pregnant, get up in the night with kids, spend holidays with in-laws when they didn‚Äôt want to, save for college and retirement, or see each other‚Äôs paychecks and credit-card bills. Living with someone may have benefits, but approximating marriage is not necessarily one of them. This is especially true at a time when the twentysomething years are touted as a chance to have fun.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1307-1313</sup></p>

* Couples who live together before marriage but after becoming engaged, who combine their lives after making a clear and public commitment, are not any more likely to have distressed or dissolved marriages than couples who do not cohabitate before marriage. They do not suffer from the cohabitation effect.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1320-1322</sup></p>

* It is the couples who live together before an engagement who are more likely to experience poorer communication, lower levels of commitment to the relationship, and greater marital instability down the road. Multiple studies have shown that those who live with their partners before an engagement are less dedicated before, and even after, marriage. This has been found to be especially true for men. A life built on top of a ‚ÄúMaybe We Will‚Äù simply may not feel as consciously committed as a life built on top of the ‚ÄúI Do‚Äù of marriage or the ‚ÄúWe Are‚Äù of engagement.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1322-1327</sup></p>

* Lock-in is the decreased likelihood to search for other options, or change to another option, once an investment in something has been made. The initial investment, called a setup cost, can be big or small. A form. An entrance fee. The hassle of creating an online account. A down payment on a car. The greater the setup costs, the less likely we are to move to another, even better, situation later. But even a minimal investment can lead to lock-in, especially when we are faced with switching costs.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1342-1346</sup></p>

* Switching costs‚Äîor the time, money, or effort it requires to make a change‚Äîare more complex. When we make an initial investment in something, switching costs are hypothetical and in the future, so we tend to underestimate them. It is easy to imagine we‚Äôll just get a new credit card later or deal with breaking a lease when the time comes. The problem is when the time does come, the switching costs seem bigger up close than they did from far away.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1346-1349</sup></p>

* Founding a relationship on convenience and ambiguity can interfere with the process of claiming the people we love. We all ought to feel confident we are choosing our partners and our partners are choosing us because we want to be with them, not because staying together is convenient or because breaking up is inconvenient.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1377-1379</sup></p>

* Cohabitating couples can break up and are a bit more likely to split than married couples. But many cohabitating couples, like Jennifer and Carter, don‚Äôt break up. They slide from dating to cohabitation. Then they lock into marriage because getting married seems easier than dividing up the furniture and starting over, especially when friends start walking down the aisle. The more aware singles are of this, the more they can understand what living together is‚Ä¶ and what it isn‚Äôt.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1379-1382</sup></p>

* moving in with someone increases your chances of locking in on someone, whether he or she is right for you or not.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1383-1384</sup></p>

* researchers also recommend getting clear on each person‚Äôs commitment level before you move in, and anticipating and regularly evaluating those constraints that may keep you from leaving even if you want to. There are also other ways to test a relationship besides moving in, including doing a wider variety of activities together than dating and sex. There are other ways to figure out whether you and your partner are in love, or even in like.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1386-1389</sup></p>

* The most difficult thing to cure is the patient‚Äôs attempt at self-cure. Very few lives are perfect and, because young people are generally resilient, many bounce back from difficulties with their own solutions in place. They may be outdated, imperfect solutions, but they are solutions nonetheless‚Äîones that usually resist dismantling.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1431-1434</sup></p>

* there‚Äôs a proverb that says ‚ÄòA raft is a good thing to have when you‚Äôre crossing a river. But when you get to the other side, put it down.‚Äô

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1439-1439</sup></p>

* High school and our twenties are not only the time when we have our most self-defining experiences, study after study shows they are also the time when we have our most self-defining memories.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1486-1489</sup></p>


* Adolescence is a time of many firsts, including our first attempt to form life stories. As we become capable of‚Äîand interested in‚Äîabstract thought, we start to put together stories about who we are and why. As our social networks expand across our teens and twenties, we repeat these stories to others and to ourselves. We use them to feel a sense of coherence as we move from place to place.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1489-1492</sup></p>

* The stories we tell about ourselves become facets of our identity. They reveal our unique complexity. All at once, they say something about friends, family, and culture. They say something about why we live as we do from year to year.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1492-1494</sup></p>

* Though some of these stories may be left untold, they are no less meaningful or powerful. Research‚Äîand clinical experience‚Äîsuggest that these untold stories are most often about shame

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1497-1499</sup></p>


* Life stories with themes of ruin can trap us. Life stories that are triumphant can transform us. So, part of what I do with clients like Cathy is help them tell their stories. Then we change them.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1504-1506</sup></p>


* ‚ÄúHow do you see me?‚Äù Cathy asked, eyes brimming with tears. This simple question left me with a hollow feeling in my throat. I knew it came from a deep sense of not being seen, from no one ever really looking at Cathy and telling her what they saw. I also knew it meant she was ready to have someone help her rewrite her story.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1524-1526</sup></p>

* I told Cathy I saw her as a person who had been made to feel ‚Äútoo much‚Äù and ‚Äúless-than‚Äù all at the same time. I told her I was concerned that if she kept dating whoever came along, she might just marry whoever came along at thirty-one or thirty-four. We spent many months talking about who she was now: a twentysomething who‚Äôd survived years of teenage rejection and emerged as an enthusiastic and beloved teacher, a budding writer, a beautiful and desirable young woman, a Korean American with special knowledge of what it means not to be seen. We spent even more months helping her shift from being wanted to wanting. Cathy had never thought about what she wanted or needed in a partner. She never thought she could do the wanting. She never thought she could take charge of her love life.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1526-1532</sup></p>

* What counts in making a happy marriage is not so much how compatible you are, but how you deal with incompatibility. ‚ÄîLeo Tolstoy, writer

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1546-1548</sup></p>


* more similar two people are, the more they are able to understand each other. Each appreciates how the other acts and how he or she goes about the day, and this forestalls an incredible amount of friction. Two people who are similar are going to have the same reactions to a rainy day, a new car, a long vacation, an anniversary, a Sunday morning, and a big party.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1585-1588</sup></p>

* Studies have repeatedly found that couples who are similar in areas such as socioeconomic status, education, age, ethnicity, religion, attractiveness, attitudes, values, and intelligence are more likely to be satisfied with their relationships and are less likely to seek divorce.

* One match maker to consider is personality. Some research tells us that, especially in young couples, the more similar two people‚Äôs personalities are, the more likely they are to be satisfied with their relationship. Yet personality is how dating, and even married, couples tend to be least alike. The likely reason for this is, unlike deal breakers, personality is less obvious and not as easy to categorize. Personality is not about what we have done or even about what we like. It is about how we are in the world, and this infuses everything we do. Personality is the part of ourselves that we take everywhere, even to Nicaragua, so it is worth knowing something about.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1603-1608</sup></p>

* Neuroticism, or the tendency to be anxious, stressed, critical, and moody, is far more predictive of relationship unhappiness and dissolution than is personality dissimilarity. While personality similarity can help the years run smoothly, any two people will be different in some way or another. How a person responds to these differences can be more important than the differences themselves. To a person who runs high in Neuroticism, differences are seen in a negative light. Anxiety and judgments about these differences then lead to criticism and contempt, two leading relationship killers

* Research on long-term marriages suggests what we need in marriage changes over time. It is a young couple‚Äôs job to create a shared vision and a shared life. When this is the task, similarities can feel validating and comforting, and differences can feel threatening. By our forties and beyond, as work, children, home, activities, extended family, and community come to the fore, marriage is typically less couple-centered. When couples are juggling more than dinners and shared weekends, a diversification of skills and interests can be helpful. Differences can keep life fresh.

* Twentysomethings take these difficult moments particularly hard. Compared to older adults, they find negative information‚Äîthe bad news‚Äîmore memorable than positive information‚Äîor the good news. MRI studies show that twentysomething brains simply react more strongly to negative information than do the brains of older adults.

* When Danielle called her mother, she was doing what psychologists call ‚Äúborrowing an ego.‚Äù She was reaching out in a moment of need and letting someone else‚Äôs frontal lobe do the work. We all need to do that sometimes, but if we externalize our distress too much, we don‚Äôt learn to handle bad days on our own. We don‚Äôt practice soothing ourselves just when our brains are in the best position to pick up new skills. We don‚Äôt learn how to calm ourselves down, and this in and of itself undermines confidence.

* The twentysomething years are no time for a postmortem. Life isn‚Äôt over. It is not too late.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2194-2195</sup></p>

* Numerous studies from around the world show that life starts to feel better across the twentysomething years. We become more emotionally stable and less tossed around by life‚Äôs ups and downs. We become more conscientious and responsible. We become more socially competent. We feel more agreeable about life and more able to cooperate with others.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2235-2238</sup></p>

* In our twenties, positive personality changes come from what researchers call ‚Äúgetting along and getting ahead.‚Äù Feeling better doesn‚Äôt come from avoiding adulthood, it comes from investing in adulthood.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2239-2241</sup></p>


* Most of these changes are about making adult commitments‚Äîto bosses, partners, leases, roommates‚Äîand these commitments shift how we are in the world and who we are inside.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2242-2244</sup></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2246-2247</sup></p>

* Even simply having goals can make us happier and more confident‚Äîboth now and later. In one study that followed nearly five hundred young adults from college to the mid-thirties, increased goal-setting in the twenties led to greater purpose, mastery, agency, and well-being in the thirties. Goals are how we declare who we are and who we want to be. They are how we structure our years and our lives. Goals have been called the building blocks of adult personality, and it is worth considering that who you will be in your thirties and beyond is being built out of the goals you are setting for yourself today.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2251-2256</sup></p>

* stable relationships helps twentysomethings feel more secure and responsible, whether these relationships last or not. Steady relationships reduce social anxiety and depression as they help us feel less lonely and give us the opportunity to practice our interpersonal skills. We learn about managing our emotions and about conflict resolution. As we take part in partnering, we find new ways to feel competent in the adult world. And on the days we do feel bad about our twenties, these relationships can be a source of security and a more mature safe haven than what we have with our parents.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2258-2263</sup></p>

* Being single while you‚Äôre young may be glorified in the press, but staying single across the twenties does not typically feel good. A study that tracked men and women from their early twenties to their later twenties found that of those who remained single‚Äîwho dated or hooked up but avoided commitments‚Äî80 percent were dissatisfied with their dating lives and only 10 percent didn‚Äôt wish they had a partner.

* Medicine has been called ‚Äúa science of uncertainty and an art of probability,‚Äù and this holds especially true for reproductive medicine. It is an imperfect science, so not all pre-thirty-five women will easily have the babies they want, nor is it true that those over thirty-five will not.

* The availability heuristic is a mental shortcut whereby we decide how likely something is based on how easy it is to bring an example to mind. Kaitlyn was right that it is more common than it used to be for older women to have babies. She personally knew two forty-year-old women who had succeeded, and she could think of lots of famous women who had as well. But she did not know the statistics about how easy it is‚Äîand is not‚Äîto have kids as we approach our forties. Kaitlyn didn‚Äôt know the facts.

* Being a parent is nothing to be idealized. As meaningful as it can be, it is also unrelenting hard work. It can be an emotional stretch. So some couples opt out of parenthood in order to focus on work or other pursuits.

* Even if we assume couples will have all the children they hope for with no trouble whatsoever, a 2010 study shows that simply postponing marriage and children leads to more stressful lives for families.

* Decades and several similar studies later, we now know that the brain has difficulty keeping time across long, unpunctuated intervals. We condense unmarked time. The days and years pass, and we say, ‚ÄúWhere did the time go?‚Äù

* a core problem in behavior: present bias. People of all ages and walks of life discount the future, favoring the rewards of today over the rewards of tomorrow. We would rather have $100 this month than $150 next month. We choose the chocolate cake and the new outfit now and face the gym and the credit card bill later.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2479-2482</sup></p>

* It‚Äôs a human tendency, one that underpins addiction, procrastination, health, oil consumption, and, yes, saving for retirement. It is often difficult to imagine and give weight to things that will happen down the line. But twentysomethings are especially prone to present bias. Their brains are still developing the forward thinking it takes to anticipate consequences and plan for the future. And when they do turn to close friends or older others with nervous questions about their lives, they often receive pats on the head and stock phrases like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll work out. You have all the time in the world.‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2482-2487</sup></p>

* At the same time, twentysomething exploits are met with more enthusiastic clich√©s, such as ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre only young once‚Äù or ‚ÄúHave fun while you can.‚Äù These messages encourage risk-taking and what one researcher calls ‚Äúnow-or-never behaviors‚Äù that don‚Äôt actually make us happy for long: partying, multiple sex partners, blowing off responsibilities, being lazy, not having a real job.

* ‚ÄúThere is a big difference between having a life in your thirties and starting a life in your thirties.‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2531-2532</sup></p>

* Present bias is especially strong in twentysomethings who put a lot of psychological distance between now and later. Love or work can seem far off in time, like the way that Rachel tossed marriage and kids decades into the future. The future can also seem socially distant when we hang out with people who are not talking about it either. Later can even feel spatially far away if we imagine ultimately settling down in some other place.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2536-2540</sup></p>

* The problem with feeling distant from the future is that distance leads to abstraction, and abstraction leads to distance, and round and round it goes. The further away love and work seem, the less we need to think about them; the less we think about love and work, the further away they feel.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2540-2542</sup></p>

* Our twenties are when we have to start creating our own sense of time, our own plans about how the years ahead will unfold. It is difficult to know how to start our careers or when to start our families. It is tempting to stay distracted and keep everything at a distance. But twentysomethings who live beyond time usually aren‚Äôt happy. It‚Äôs like living in a cave where we never know what time it is or what we ought to do or why, sometimes until it is too late.

* How do you get the happy ending? John Irving ought to know. One of my favorite authors, Irving writes these multigenerational epics of fiction that somehow work out in the end. How does he do it? He says, ‚ÄúI always begin with the last sentence; then I work my way backwards, through the plot, to where the story should begin.‚Äù That sounds like a lot of work, especially compared to the fantasy that great writers sit down and just go where the story takes them. Irving lets us know that good stories, and happy endings, are more intentional than that.

* Adulthood is sort of like that. There are things that just are what they are. The smartest thing to do is know as much about them as you can.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2600-2601</sup></p>

* There is no formula for a good life, and there is no right or wrong life. But there are choices and consequences, so it seems only fair that twentysomethings know about the ones that lie ahead. That way, the future feels good when you finally get there. The nicest part about getting older is knowing how your life worked out, especially if you like what you wake up to every day. If you are paying attention to your life as a twentysomething, the real glory days are still to come.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2607-2610</sup></p>

* The future isn‚Äôt written in the stars. There are no guarantees. So claim your adulthood. Be intentional. Get to work. Pick your family. Do the math. Make your own certainty. Don‚Äôt be defined by what you didn‚Äôt know or didn‚Äôt do. You are deciding your life right now.
