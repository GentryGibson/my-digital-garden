## üìî Book Report

### üöÄ Summary

This is a book that talks about the Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten system (or slip-box as the book calls it.) It gives a step-by-step process on how to implement that system to your workflow, as well as the benefits of using it.

### üé® Impressions

The book has a lot to say about the slip-box system. Using this system lets you have a "thinking partner" which helps you create manuscripts without the dread of staring at the blank page.

There are some concepts that I thought were a little confusing (it might just be a "me problem") which lead me to reading some articles to supplement my understanding of it. It may be helpful to read some reviews on the book first as they summarize the bulk of its contents and offers a step-by-step process of using the system. Check out [this article](https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/) as a primer or [this one](https://www.knowledgeworker.blog/p/how-to-take-smart-notes-in-obsidian) if a hands-on tutorial is more of your thing.

Despite that, the book is readable and might even change how you write down and process notes. It may even lead you to the big rabbithole of articles about taking smart notes and Zettelkasten.

### ‚òò How the Book Changed Me

I've read articles on how to implement the Zettelkasten system long before reading this book and both had changed the way on how I approach consuming media as a whole.

Whenever I read or watch something, I have a handy-dandy notebook with me or a note-taking app to take down the things that I want to remember and retrieve for later. These notes are then linked to other notes with similarities which leads to gaining new insight.

Adopting this system requires a lot of unlearning on my part. I have to unlearn memorizing certain things or directly copying something from a source material. These were all things that I learned in school which were not effective when it comes to learning. 


### ü•∞ Who Would Like It?
Anyone who dreads having to look at the blank screen and not knowing what to write may benefit from reading this book and adopting the Zettelkasten system. 

It might even be beneficial for "content creators" as a whole. Want to make a video essay comparing two unlikely things? If you have notes about those two, then you pretty much have a working "thesis" ready to be scripted and filmed.


### ‚úçÔ∏è My Top 3 Quotes
- Mistaking learning with cramming is still very much ingrained in our educational culture.
- A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes.
- Every time we read something, we make a decision on what is worth writing down and what is not.
