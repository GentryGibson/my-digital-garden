## üìî Book Report

### üöÄ Summary

This is a book that talks about Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten system (or slip-box as the book calls it.) It gives a step-by-step process on how to implement that system to your workflow, as well as the benefits of using it.

### üé® Impressions

The book has a lot to say about the slip-box system. Using this system lets you have a "thinking partner" which helps you create manuscripts without the dread of staring at the blank page.

There are some concepts that I thought were a little confusing (it might just be a "me problem") which lead me to reading some articles to supplement my understanding of it. It may be helpful to read some reviews on the book first as they summarize the bulk of its contents and offers a step-by-step process of using the system. Check out [this article](https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/) as a primer or [this one](https://www.knowledgeworker.blog/p/how-to-take-smart-notes-in-obsidian) if a hands-on tutorial is more of your thing.

Despite that, the book is readable and might even change how you write down and process notes. It may even lead you to the big rabbithole of articles about taking smart notes and Zettelkasten.

### ‚òò How the Book Changed Me

I've read articles on how to implement the Zettelkasten system long before reading this book and both had changed the way on how I approach consuming media as a whole.

Whenever I read or watch something, I have a handy-dandy notebook with me or a note-taking app to take down the things that I want to remember and retrieve for later. These notes are then linked to other notes with similarities which leads to gaining new insight.

Adopting this system requires a lot of unlearning on my part. I have to unlearn memorizing certain things or directly copying something from a source material. These were all things that I learned in school which were not effective when it comes to learning. 


### ü•∞ Who Would Like It?
Anyone who dreads having to look at the blank screen and not knowing what to write may benefit from reading this book and adopting the Zettelkasten system. 

It might even be beneficial for "content creators" as a whole. Want to make a video essay comparing two unlikely things? If you have notes about those two, then you pretty much have a working "thesis" ready to be scripted and filmed.


### ‚úçÔ∏è My Top 3 Quotes
- Mistaking learning with cramming is still very much ingrained in our educational culture.
- A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes.
- Every time we read something, we make a decision on what is worth writing down and what is not.

* they ignore the main part, namely note-taking, failing to understand that improving the organisation of all writing makes a difference.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 100-101</sup></p>

* how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way. You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas. But most of all, you can write every day in a way that brings your projects forward

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 102-105</sup></p>

* There is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don‚Äôt experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly. But without an immediate experience of failure, there is also not much demand for help.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 111-113</sup></p>

* If we take notes unsystematically, inefficiently or simply wrong, we might not even realise it until we are in the midst of a deadline panic and wonder why there always seem to be a few who get a lot of good writing done and still have time for a coffee every time we ask them. And even then, it is more likely that some form of rationalization will cloud the view of the actual reason, which is most likely the difference between good and bad note-taking.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 115-118</sup></p>

* The right question is: What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even years before we face the blank page that will get us into the best possible position to write a great paper easily?

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 120-122</sup></p>

* productive writing is based on good note-taking. Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 127-129</sup></p>

* The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 129-130</sup></p>

* What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 137-138</sup></p>


* Willpower is, as far as we know today, a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 143-145</sup></p>

* self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) ‚Äì and the environment can be changed.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 147-148</sup></p>

* Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 150-152</sup></p>

* ‚ÄúI never force myself to do anything I don‚Äôt feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.‚Äù A good structure allows you to do that, to move seamlessly from one task to another ‚Äì without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 158-160</sup></p>


* If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 161-163</sup></p>

* A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975). Something like that does not happen by chance.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 164-166</sup></p>


* Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement ‚Äì which we ideally have on a regular basis and not just as an exception.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 170-174</sup></p>

* Planners are also unlikely to continue with their studies after they finish their examinations. They are rather glad it is over. Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 181-183</sup></p>


* Having read more does not automatically mean having more ideas. Especially in the beginning, it means having fewer ideas to work with, because you know that others have already thought of most of them.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 188-190</sup></p>


* Good students also look beyond the obvious. They peek over the fences of their own disciplines ‚Äì and once you have done that, you cannot go back and do what everyone else is doing, even if you now must deal with heterogeneous ideas that come without a manual on how they might fit together. All that means is that a system is needed to keep track of the ever-increasing pool of information, which allows one to combine different ideas in an intelligent way with the aim of generating new ideas.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 190-194</sup></p>

* Poor students do not have any of these problems. As long as they stick within the boundaries of their discipline and read only as much as they are told to (or less), no serious external system is required and writing can be done by sticking with the usual formulas of ‚Äúhow to write a scientific paper.‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 194-196</sup></p>

* poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested), because they don‚Äôt experience much self-doubt. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 196-197</sup></p>

* those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 199-200</sup></p>

* Poor students also have no trouble finding a question to write about: they neither lack opinions nor the confidence that they have already thought them through. They also won‚Äôt have trouble finding confirming evidence in the literature as they usually lack both interest and skill to detect and think through dis-confirming facts and arguments.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 200-203</sup></p>

* Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves as they focus on what they haven‚Äôt learned and mastered yet. This is why high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 203-205</sup></p>

* insight doesn‚Äôt come easy and that writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 206-208</sup></p>

* There is no need to build a complex system and there is no need to reorganise everything you already have. You can start working and developing ideas immediately by taking smart notes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 210-212</sup></p>

* Most people try to reduce complexity by separating what they have into smaller stacks, piles or separate folders. They sort their notes by topics and sub-topics, which makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes very complicated. Plus, it reduces the likelihood of building and finding surprising connections between the notes themselves, which means a trade-off between its usability and usefulness.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 214-217</sup></p>

* The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles. The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level. There is quite extensive empirical and logical research on this phenomenon

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 218-220</sup></p>

* The importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of David Allen‚Äôs ‚ÄúGetting Things Done‚Äù (Allen, 2001). There are few serious knowledge workers left who haven‚Äôt heard of ‚ÄúGTD‚Äù and that is for a good reason: It works. The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 238-240</sup></p>

* ‚Äúmind like water‚Äù - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 244-244</sup></p>

* most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 246-247</sup></p>

* Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 342-343</sup></p>


* if you don‚Äôt have an external system to think in and organise your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just can‚Äôt be compensated by a high IQ.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 349-351</sup></p>

* Intuitively, most people do not expect much from simple ideas. They rather assume that impressive results must have equally impressively complicated means.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 363-365</sup></p>

* How does the slip-box, the heart of this system, work? Strictly speaking, Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read. The notes were written on index cards and stored in wooden boxes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 373-377</sup></p>

* Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 377-379</sup></p>

* Luhmann developed topics bottom up, then added another note to his slip-box, on which he would sort a topic by sorting the links of the relevant other notes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 404-406</sup></p>

* We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. But first, let me guide you through the process of writing a paper with the slip-box.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 413-415</sup></p>

* Assemble notes and bring them into order, turn these notes into a draft, review it and you are done.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 439-440</sup></p>

* Notes build up while you think, read, understand and generate ideas, because you have to have a pen in your hand if you want to think, read, understand and generate ideas properly anyway.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 449-450</sup></p>

* If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 450-451</sup></p>

* ‚ÄúNotes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible,‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 452-453</sup></p>

* Richard Feynman stresses it as much as Benjamin Franklin. If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read, remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense. And if we have to write anyway, why not use our writing to build up the resources for our future publications?

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 456-459</sup></p>


* If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read, remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense. And if we have to write anyway, why not use our writing to build up the resources for our future publications?

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 457-459</sup></p>

* Writing a paper step by step 1. Make fleeting notes. Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 461-464</sup></p>

* 2. Make literature notes. Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down what you don‚Äôt want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing. Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and use your own words.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 469-471</sup></p>

* 3. Make permanent notes. Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 473-475</sup></p>

* The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 475-476</sup></p>

* Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. Throw away the fleeting notes from step one and put the literature notes from step two into your reference system.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 477-479</sup></p>

* Now add your new permanent notes to the slip-box

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 481-481</sup></p>

* Develop your topics, questions and research projects bottom up from within the system. See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 491-492</sup></p>

* follow your interest and always take the path that promises the most insight. Build upon what you have.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 493-494</sup></p>

* Do not brainstorm for a topic. Look into the slip-box instead to see where chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 495-496</sup></p>

* The more you become interested in something, the more you will read and think about it, the more notes you will collect and the more likely it is that you will generate questions from it. It might be exactly what you were interested in from the beginning, but it is more likely that your interests will have changed ‚Äì that is what insight does.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 497-500</sup></p>

* Your topic is now based on what you have, not based on an unfounded idea about what the literature you are about to read might provide.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 500-501</sup></p>


* Turn your notes into a rough draft. Don‚Äôt simply copy your notes into a manuscript. Translate them into something coherent and embed them into the context of your argument while you build your argument out of the notes at the same time.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 506-508</sup></p>

* We constantly encounter interesting ideas along the way and only a fraction of them are useful for the particular paper we started reading it for. Why let them go to waste? Make a note and add it to your slip-box. It improves it. Every idea adds to what can become a critical mass that turns a mere collection of ideas into an idea-generator.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 520-523</sup></p>

* Focus on the essentials, don‚Äôt complicate things unnecessarily

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 542-543</sup></p>

* Instead of having different storage for different ideas, everything goes into the same slip-box and is standardised into the same format. Instead of focusing on the in-between steps and trying to make a science out of underlining systems, reading techniques or excerpt writing, everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 732-735</sup></p>

* Fleeting notes, which are only reminders of information, can be written in any kind of way and will end up in the trash within a day or two. 2.¬†¬†¬† Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either in the reference system or, written as if for print, in the slip-box. 3.¬†¬†¬† Project notes, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded or archived after the project is finished.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 745-753</sup></p>

* A typical mistake is made by many diligent students who are adhering to the advice to keep a scientific journal.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 755-756</sup></p>

* and often makes a few quick notes during a conversation. The advantage is obvious: No idea ever gets lost. The disadvantages are serious, though: As he treats every note as if it belongs to the ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù category, the notes will never build up a critical mass. The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. On top of that, the strict chronological order does not offer any help to find, combine or rearrange ideas in a productive sense. It is not surprising that my friend has a bookshelf filled with notebooks full of wonderful ideas, but not a single publication to show.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 757-763</sup></p>


* The second typical mistake is to collect notes only related to specific projects. On first sight, it makes much more sense. You decide on what you are going to write about and then collect everything that helps you to do that. The disadvantage is that you have to start all over after each project and cut off all other promising lines of thought. That means that everything you found, thought or encountered during the time of a project will be lost.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 763-766</sup></p>

* The third typical mistake is, of course, to treat all notes as fleeting ones.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 770-771</sup></p>


* Even small amounts of unclear and unrelated notes lingering around your desk will soon induce the wish of starting from scratch.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 772-774</sup></p>

* Fleeting notes are there for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doing something else. When you are in a conversation, listing to a lecture, hear something noteworthy or an idea pops into your mind while you are running errands, a quick note is the best you can do without interrupting what you are in the middle of doing.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 778-780</sup></p>

* It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text. They will very soon become completely useless ‚Äì unless you do something with them.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 782-783</sup></p>



* Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. Fleeting literature notes can make sense if you need an extra step to understand or grasp an idea, but they will not help you in the later stages of the writing process, as no underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 784-787</sup></p>

* These kinds of notes are just reminders of a thought, which you haven‚Äôt had the time to elaborate on yet. Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 787-789</sup></p>

* A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal. In the first case, you forgot what it was supposed to remind you of. In the second case, you forgot the context that gave it its meaning.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 791-794</sup></p>

* In contrast to the fleeting notes, every permanent note for the slip-box is elaborated enough to have the potential to become part of or inspire a final written piece, but that can not be decided on up front as their relevance depends on future thinking and developments. The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 804-807</sup></p>

* Project-related notes can be: ¬∑      comments in the manuscript ¬∑      collections of project-related literature ¬∑      outlines ¬∑      snippets of drafts ¬∑      reminders ¬∑      to-do lists ¬∑      and of course the draft itself.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 815-827</sup></p>

* ‚ÄúThe white sheet of paper ‚Äì or today: the blank screen ‚Äì is a fundamental misunderstanding‚Äù (Nassehi 2015, 185)

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 840-841</sup></p>

* Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 856-857</sup></p>

* Basically, that is what Hans-Georg Gadamer called the hermeneutic circle (Gadamer 2004). And even though the hermeneutic circle is regularly taught in university, writing at the same time continues to be taught as if we could start from scratch and move forward in a straight line ‚Äì as if it were possible to pull a good question out of thin air and wait with the reading until the literature research is done.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 857-860</sup></p>


* We have to read with a pen in hand, develop ideas on paper and build up an ever-growing pool of externalised thoughts. We will not be guided by a blindly made-up plan picked from our unreliable brains, but by our interest, curiosity and intuition, which is formed and informed by the actual work of reading, thinking, discussing, writing and developing ideas ‚Äì and is something that continuously grows and reflects our knowledge and understanding externally.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 863-867</sup></p>

* If we look into our slip-box to see where clusters have built up, we not only see possible topics, but topics we have already worked on ‚Äì even if we were not able to see it up front. The idea that nobody ever starts from scratch suddenly becomes very concrete. If we take it seriously and work accordingly, we literally never have to start from scratch again.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 870-873</sup></p>


* As proper note-taking is rarely taught or discussed, it is no wonder that almost every guide on writing recommends to start with brainstorming. If you haven‚Äôt written along the way, the brain is indeed the only place to turn to. On its own, it is not such a great choice: it is neither objective nor reliable ‚Äì two quite important aspects in academic or nonfiction writing.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 877-880</sup></p>

* Taking smart notes is the precondition to break with the linear order. There is one reliable sign if you managed to structure your workflow according to the fact that writing is not a linear process, but a circular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 887-889</sup></p>

* If you on the other hand develop your thinking in writing, open questions will become clearly visible and give you an abundance of possible topics to elaborate further in writing.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 890-892</sup></p>

* These study guides, which neglect everything before a writing assignment is given, are a little bit like financial advisors who discuss how 65-year-olds can save for retirement. At this point you would be better off curbing your enthusiasm (which is exactly what one of the most often sold study guides in Germany recommends: first, lower your expectations on quality and insight).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 898-901</sup></p>

* A good workflow can easily turn into a virtuous circle, where the positive experience motivates us to take on the next task with ease, which helps us to get better at what we are doing, which in return makes it more likely for us to enjoy the work, and so on.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 922-924</sup></p>

* Any attempts to trick ourselves into work with external rewards (like doing something nice after finishing a chapter) are only short-term solutions with no prospect of establishing a positive feedback loop. These are very fragile motivational constructions.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 926-928</sup></p>

* Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward (DePasque and Tricomi, 2015).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 928-929</sup></p>

* Feedback loops are not only crucial for the dynamics of motivation, but also the key element to any learning process. Nothing motivates us more than the experience of becoming better at what we do. And the only chance to improve in something is getting timely and concrete feedback

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 937-939</sup></p>

* Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn, or in the more general terms of psychologist Carol Dweck, to grow. Dweck shows convincingly that the most reliable predictor for long-term success is having a ‚Äúgrowth mindset.‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 939-941</sup></p>

* Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which is outwardly rewarding). The orientation towards the latter makes one stick to safe, proven areas. The orientation towards the first draws the attention to the areas most in need of improvement.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 947-949</sup></p>

* It is the simplest test: We tend to think we understand what we read ‚Äì until we try to rewrite it in our own words. By doing this, we not only get a better sense of our ability to understand, but also increase our ability to clearly and concisely express our understanding ‚Äì which in return helps to grasp ideas more quickly.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 961-964</sup></p>

* Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 961-961</sup></p>

* The ability to express understanding in one‚Äôs own words is a fundamental competency for everyone who writes ‚Äì and only by doing it with the chance of realizing our lack of understanding can we become better at it. But the better we become, the easier and quicker we can make notes, which again increases the number of learning experiences.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 966-968</sup></p>


* The same applies to the crucial ability to distinguish the important bits of a text from the less important ones: the better we become at it, the more effective our reading will become, the more we can read, the more we will learn. We will enter a beautiful, virtuous circle of competency. You cannot help but feel motivated by it.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 968-971</sup></p>

* Expressing our own thoughts in writing makes us realise if we really thought them through. The moment we try to combine them with previously written notes, the system will unambiguously show us contradictions, inconsistencies and repetitions.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 971-973</sup></p>

* But we know today that the more connected information we already have, the easier it is to learn, because new information can dock to that information. Yes, our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age. But if facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas, or ‚Äúlatticework of mental models‚Äù (Munger, 1994), it becomes easier to make sense of new information. That makes it easier not only to learn and remember, but also to retrieve the information later in the moment and context it is needed.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 984-988</sup></p>


* Psychologists who interviewed the multitaskers did test them instead of just asking. They gave them different tasks to accomplish and compared their results with another group that was instructed to do only one thing at a time. The outcome is unambiguous: While those who multitasked felt more productive, their productivity actually decreased ‚Äì a lot

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1018-1021</sup></p>

* In some areas, like texting and driving, the downsides of multitasking are painfully obvious. But what is most interesting about these studies is not the fact that the productivity and the quality of the work decreases with multitasking, but that it also impairs the ability to deal with more than one thing at a time!

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1022-1025</sup></p>

* When we think we multitask, what we really do is shift our attention quickly between two (or more) things. And every shift is a drain on our ability to shift and delays the moment we manage to get focused again. Trying to multitask fatigues us and decreases our ability to deal with more than one task.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1027-1030</sup></p>

* The fact that people nevertheless believe that they can get better at it and increase their productivity can easily be explained by two factors. The first is the lack of a control group or an objective external measurement that would provide us with the feedback we need to learn. The second is what psychologists call the mere-exposure effect: doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it ‚Äì completely independent of our actual performance (Bornstein 1989). We unfortunately tend to confuse familiarity with skill.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1030-1034</sup></p>

* _Note:_
Why people believe in multitasking

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>note @ loc. 1033</sup></p>


* Writing a paper involves much more than just typing on the keyboard. It also means reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting and rewriting. All these are not just different tasks, but tasks requiring a different kind of attention. It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1037-1041</sup></p>

* Focused attention is different from ‚Äúsustained attention,‚Äù which we need to stay focused on one task for a longer period and is necessary to learn, understand or get something done. This is the kind of attention that is most certainly under threat from an increase in distractions. The average duration seems to have shrunken quite considerably over time ‚Äì we practice much less focused attention than we used to (ibid).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1049-1052</sup></p>

* The good news is that we can train ourselves to stay focused on one thing for longer if we avoid multitasking, remove possible distractions and separate different kinds of tasks as much as possible so they will not interfere with each other. This too is not just a question of having the right mindset, but, equally important, of how we organise our workflow. A lack of structure makes it much more challenging to stay focused for extended periods of time.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1052-1055</sup></p>

* The slip-box provides not only a clear structure to work in, but also forces us to shift our attention consciously as we can complete tasks in reasonable time before moving on to the next one. Together with the fact that every task is accompanied by writing, which in itself requires undistracted attention, the slip-box can become a haven for our restless minds.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1055-1058</sup></p>

* Proofreading, for example, is obviously part of the writing process, but requires a very different state of mind than the attempt to find the right words.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1062-1063</sup></p>

* While taking on the role of a critic is not the same as being an impartial reader, it is enough to spot most of what we missed before: the holes in the argument, the parts we did not explain as we did not need to explain them to ourselves

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1066-1068</sup></p>

* If we proofread a manuscript and don‚Äôt manage to get enough distance from ourselves as authors, we will only see our thoughts, not the actual text.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1069-1070</sup></p>

* If the critic constantly and prematurely interferes whenever a sentence isn‚Äôt perfect yet, we would never get anything on paper.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1074-1075</sup></p>

* We need to get our thoughts on paper first and improve them there, where we can look at them. Especially complex ideas are difficult to turn into a linear text in the head alone.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1075-1076</sup></p>

* We tend to call extremely slow writers, who always try to write as if for print, perfectionists. Even though it sounds like praise for extreme professionalism, it is not: A real professional would wait until it was time for proofreading, so he or she can focus on one thing at a time. While proofreading requires more focused attention, finding the right words during writing requires much more floating attention

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1077-1079</sup></p>

* It is also easier to focus on finding the right words if we don‚Äôt have to think about the structure of the text at the same time, which is why a printed outline of the manuscript should be always in front of our eyes. We have to know what we don‚Äôt have to write about at the moment, because we know that we will take care of that in another part of our text.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1080-1083</sup></p>

* It is important, though, to understand outlining not as the preparation of writing or even as planning, but as a separate task we need to return to throughout the writing process on a regular basis.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1084-1085</sup></p>

* We need a structure all the time, but as we work our way bottom-up, it is bound to change often. And whenever we need to update the structure, we need to take a step back, look at the big picture and change it accordingly.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1085-1088</sup></p>

* Working with the slip-box means playing with ideas and looking out for interesting connections and comparisons. It means building clusters, combining them with other clusters and preparing the order of notes for a project.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1088-1090</sup></p>

* Proofreading, formulating and outlining are also different from the task of combining and developing thoughts.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1088-1088</sup></p>

* Reading in itself can require very different kinds of attention, depending on the text.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1092-1092</sup></p>

* It would be ridiculous to adhere to a general formula and read every text in the same way, even though that is what many study guides or speed-reading courses try to convince us of. It is not a sign of professionalism to master one technique and stick to it no matter what, but to be flexible and adjust one‚Äôs reading to whatever speed or approach a text requires.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1093-1096</sup></p>

* In short, academic writing requires the whole spectrum of attention. To master the art of writing, we need to be able to apply whatever kind of attention and focus is needed.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1096-1098</sup></p>

* ‚ÄúSpecifically, the problem-solving behavior of eminent scientists can alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas. This suggests that successful problem solving may be a function of flexible strategy application in relation to task demands.‚Äù (Vartanian 2009, 57)

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1102-1104</sup></p>

* ‚ÄúOn one hand, those with wandering, defocused, childlike minds seem to be the most creative; on the other, it seems to be analysis and application that‚Äôs important. The answer to this conundrum is that creative people need both ‚Ä¶ The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.‚Äù (Dean, 2013, 152)

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1105-1108</sup></p>

* Unfortunately, the most common way people organise their writing is by making plans. Although planning is almost universally recommended by study guides, it‚Äôs the equivalent of putting oneself on rails. Don‚Äôt make plans. Become an expert.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1113-1116</sup></p>

* The moment we stop making plans is the moment we start to learn. It is a matter of practice to become good at generating insight and write good texts by choosing and moving flexibly between the most important and promising tasks, judged by nothing else than the circumstances of the given situation.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1122-1124</sup></p>

* Similarly, no one would ever learn the art of productive academic writing just by following plans or linear, multistep prescripts ‚Äì one would learn only to follow plans or prescripts.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1127-1128</sup></p>

* Each new project is different, and at each stage of the project, it might be best to read up on something, to review a passage, to discuss an idea or to change the outline of the manuscript.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1133-1134</sup></p>

* Teachers tend to mistake the ability to follow (their) rules with the ability to make the right choices in real situations. Unlike the expert paramedics, they did not look at the unique circumstances and check if the paramedics in the videos did the best thing possible in each individual situation. Instead, they focused on the question of whether the people in the videos acted according to the rules they taught.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1149-1152</sup></p>

* Experts, on the other hand, have internalised the necessary knowledge so they don‚Äôt have to actively remember rules or think consciously about their choices. They have acquired enough experience in various situations to be able to rely on their intuition to know what to do in which kind of situation. Their decisions in complex situations are explicitly not made by long rational-analytical considerations, but rather come from the gut (cf. Gigerenzer, 2008a, 2008b).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1156-1160</sup></p>

* We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1180-1181</sup></p>

* Information cannot be saved in short-term memory like on a memory stick. Rather, it kind of floats around in our heads, seeks our attention and occupies valuable mental resources until it is either forgotten, replaced by something more important (according to our brains) or moved into long-term memory.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1181-1183</sup></p>

* Things we understand are connected, either through rules, theories, narratives, pure logic, mental models or explanations. And deliberately building these kinds of meaningful connections is what the slip-box is all about.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1197-1199</sup></p>

* Zeigarnik successfully reproduced what is now known as the Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory ‚Äì until they are done. That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1211-1213</sup></p>

* The brain doesn't distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note. By writing something down, we literally get it out of our heads.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1214-1216</sup></p>

* This is why David Allen‚Äôs ‚ÄúGetting things done‚Äù system works: The secret to have a ‚Äúmind like water‚Äù is to get all the little stuff out of our short-term memory. And as we can‚Äôt take care of everything once and for all right now, the only way to do that is to have a reliable external system in place where we can keep all our nagging thoughts about the many things that need to be done and trust that they will not be lost.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1216-1219</sup></p>

* The first step is to break down the amorphous task of ‚Äúwriting‚Äù into smaller pieces of different tasks that can be finished in one go. The second step is to make sure we always write down the outcome of our thinking, including possible connections to further inquiries.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1221-1223</sup></p>

* As the outcome of each task is written down and possible connections become visible, it is easy to pick up the work any time where we left it without having to keep it in mind all the time.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1223-1224</sup></p>

* All this enables us to later pick up a task exactly where we stopped without the need to ‚Äúkeep in mind‚Äù that there still was something to do. That is one of the main advantages of thinking in writing ‚Äì everything is externalised anyway.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1229-1231</sup></p>

* Conversely, we can use the Zeigarnik effect to our advantage by deliberately keeping unanswered questions in our mind. We can ruminate about them, even when we do something that has nothing to do with work and ideally does not require our full attention. Letting thoughts linger without focusing on them gives our brains the opportunity to deal with problems in a different, often surprisingly productive way.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1231-1234</sup></p>

* Today, willpower is compared to muscles: a limited resource that depletes quickly and needs time to recover.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1244-1245</sup></p>

* The phenomenon is usually discussed under the term ‚Äúego depletion‚Äù: ‚ÄúWe use the term ego depletion to refer to a temporary reduction in the self‚Äôs capacity or willingness to engage in volitional action (including controlling the environment, controlling the self, making choices, and initiating action) caused by prior exercise of volition.‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1246-1248</sup></p>

* The smartest way to deal with this kind of limitation is to cheat. Instead of forcing ourselves to do something we don‚Äôt feel like doing, we need to find a way to make us feel like doing what moves our project further along. Doing the work that need to be done without having to apply too much willpower requires a technique, a ruse.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1258-1260</sup></p>

* By always using the same notebook for making quick notes, always extracting the main ideas from a text in the same way and always turning them into the same kind of permanent notes, which are always dealt with in the same manner, the number of decisions during a work session can be greatly reduced. That leaves us with much more mental energy that we can direct towards more useful tasks, like trying to solve the problems in question.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1268-1272</sup></p>

* Being able to finish a task in a timely manner and to pick up the work exactly where we left it has another enjoyable advantage that helps to restore our attention: We can have breaks without fear of losing the thread.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1272-1273</sup></p>

* Breaks are much more than just opportunities to recover. They are crucial for learning. They allow the brain to process information, move it into long-term memory and prepare it for new information (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013, 69).[23] If we don‚Äôt give ourselves a break in between work sessions, be it out of eagerness or fear of forgetting what we were doing, it can have a detrimental effect on our efforts. To have a walk (Ratey, 2008) or even a nap[24] supports learning and thinking.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1273-1279</sup></p>

* ‚ÄúI would advise you to read with a pen in your hand and enter in a little book short hints of what you feel that is common or that may be useful; for this will be the best method of imprinting such portcullis in your memory.‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1283-1285</sup></p>

* If you understand what you read and translate it into the different context of your own thinking, materialised in the slip-box, you cannot help but transform the findings and thoughts of others into something that is new and your own.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1291-1292</sup></p>

* The series of notes in the slip-box develops into arguments, which are shaped by the theories, ideas and mental models you have in your head. And the theories, ideas and mental models in your head are also shaped by the things you read. They are constantly changing and challenged by the surprising connections with which the slip-box confronts you.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1293-1295</sup></p>

* The slip-box is an idea generator that develops in lockstep with your own intellectual development. Together, you can turn previously separated or even isolated facts into a critical mass of interconnected ideas.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1295-1297</sup></p>

* While the notes themselves are formulated so that they can be understood on their own, they are at the same time embedded in one or more contexts that enrich their meaning.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1299-1300</sup></p>

* When we extract ideas from the specific context of a text, we deal with ideas that serve a specific purpose in a particular context, support a specific argument, are part of a theory that isn‚Äôt ours or written in a language we wouldn‚Äôt use. This is why we have to translate them into our own language to prepare them to be embedded into new contexts of our own thinking, the different context(s) within the slip-box.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1304-1307</sup></p>

* the mere copying of quotes almost always changes their meaning by stripping them out of context, even though the words aren‚Äôt changed. This is a common beginner mistake, which can only lead to a patchwork of ideas, but never a coherent thought.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1308-1310</sup></p>

* As literature notes are also a tool for understanding and grasping the text, more elaborate notes make sense in more challenging cases, while in easier cases it might be sufficient to just jot down some keywords.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1317-1318</sup></p>

* Whenever we explore a new, unfamiliar subject, our notes will tend to be more extensive, but we shouldn‚Äôt get nervous about it, as this is the deliberate practice of understanding we cannot skip.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1322-1323</sup></p>

* The only thing that matters is that these notes provide the best possible support for the next step, the writing of the actual slip-box notes. And what is most helpful is to reflect on the frame, the theoretical background, methodological approach or perspective of the text we read. That often means to reflect as much on what is not mentioned as what is mentioned.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1324-1327</sup></p>

* Sometimes the only thing that is done is underlining sentences and making some comments in the margins of a book, which is almost like taking no notes at all. And more often than not, reading is not accompanied by taking notes, which is, in terms of writing, almost as valuable as not having read at all. Here, everything is about building up a critical mass of useful notes in the slip-box, which gives us a clear idea of how to read and how to take literature notes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1332-1336</sup></p>

* You need to take some form of literature note that captures your understanding of the text, so you have something in front of your eyes while you are making the slip-box note. But don‚Äôt turn it into a project in itself. Literature notes are short and meant to help with writing slip-box notes. Everything else either helps to get to this point or is a distraction.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1339-1342</sup></p>

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1345-1346</sup></p>

* So if you are writing by hand, you are forced to think about what you hear (or read) ‚Äì otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt be able to grasp the underlying principle, the idea, the structure of an argument. Handwriting makes pure copying impossible, but instead facilitates the translation of what is said (or written) into one‚Äôs own words.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1350-1352</sup></p>

* Verbatim notes can be taken with almost no thinking, as if the words are taking a short cut from the ear to the hand, bypassing the brain.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1354-1355</sup></p>

* But whether you write them by hand or not, keep in mind that it is all about the essence, the understanding and preparation for the next step ‚Äì the transferring of ideas into the context of your own lines of thoughts in the slip-box.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1357-1360</sup></p>

* While we should seek out dis-confirming arguments and facts that challenge our way of thinking, we are naturally drawn to everything that makes us feel good, which is everything that confirms what we already believe we know.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1363-1365</sup></p>

* The very moment we decide on a hypothesis, our brains automatically go into search mode, scanning our surroundings for supporting data, which is neither a good way to learn nor research. Worse, we are usually not even aware of this confirmation bias (or myside bias[28]) that surreptitiously meddles with our life.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1365-1368</sup></p>


* We look around and just cut out dis-confirming facts without even noticing what we don‚Äôt see, very much like the same city can one day be full of happy people and the other day full of miserable ones, depending on our mood.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1372-1374</sup></p>

* the psychologist Raymond Nickerson puts it: ‚ÄúIf one were to attempt to identify a single problematic aspect of human reasoning that deserves attention above all others, the confirmation bias would have to be among the candidates for consideration‚Äù (Nickerson 1998, 175).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1374-1376</sup></p>

* ‚ÄúI had [...] during many years followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favorable ones. Owing to this habit, very few objections were raised against my views, which I had not at least noticed and attempted to answer.‚Äù (Darwin 1958, 123)

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>note @ loc. 1382</sup></p>

* Confirmation bias is tackled here in two steps: First, by turning the whole writing process on its head, and secondly, by changing the incentives from finding confirming facts to an indiscriminate gathering of any relevant information regardless of what argument it will support.

* If insight becomes a threat to your academic or writing success, you are doing it wrong.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1393-1394</sup></p>


* Developing arguments and ideas bottom-up instead of top-down is the first and most important step to opening ourselves up for insight.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1394-1395</sup></p>

* We postpone the decision on what to write about specifically and focus on building a critical mass within the slip-box. Instead of having the hypothesis in mind all the time, we want to: ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬† Confirm that we have separated tasks and focus on understanding the text we read, ¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬† Make sure we have given a true account of its content ¬∑     Find the relevance of it and make connections.

* The experience of how one piece of information can change the whole perspective on a certain problem is exciting. And the more diverse the content of the slip-box is, the further it can bring our thinking forward ‚Äì provided we haven‚Äôt decided on the direction upfront

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1416-1418</sup></p>


* It is so much easier to develop an interesting text from a lively discussion with a lot of pros and cons than from a collection of one-sided notes and seemingly fitting quotes. In fact, it is almost impossible to write anything interesting and worth publishing (and therefore motivating) if it is based on nothing else than an idea we were able to come up with up front before elaborating on the problem.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1419-1422</sup></p>

* The slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed. It just prefers relevant notes. It is after reading and collecting relevant data, connecting thoughts and discussing how they fit together that it is time to draw conclusions and develop a linear structure for the argument.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1422-1425</sup></p>

* The ability to distinguish relevant from less relevant information is another skill that can only be learned by doing. It is the practice of looking for the gist and distinguishing it from mere supporting details.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1427-1428</sup></p>

* Extracting the gist of a text or an idea and giving an account in writing is for academics what daily practice on the piano is for pianists: The more often we do it and the more focused we are, the more virtuous we become.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1429-1432</sup></p>

* But with the learned ability of spotting patterns, we can enter the circle of virtuosity: Reading becomes easier, we grasp the gist quicker, can read more in less time, and can more easily spot patterns and improve our understanding of them. And along the way, we increase our set of thinking tools, which will not only help with academic work, but with thinking and understanding in general.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1435-1438</sup></p>

* But this dynamic can only start if we ourselves deliberately decide to take on the task of reading and being selective about it, relying on nothing other than our own judgement of what is important and what is not.

* ‚ÄúNonage [immaturity] is the inability to use one‚Äôs own understanding without another‚Äôs guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one‚Äôs own mind without another‚Äôs guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) ‚ÄòHave the courage to use your own understanding,‚Äô is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.‚Äù (Kant 1784)

* One has to read extremely selectively and extract widespread and connected references. One has to be able to follow recurrences

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1450-1451</sup></p>

* But how to learn it if guidance is impossible? [‚Ä¶] Probably the best method is to take notes ‚Äì not excerpts, but condensed reformulated accounts of a text. Rewriting what was already written almost automatically trains one to shift the attention towards frames, patterns and categories in the observations, or the conditions/assumptions, which enable certain, but not other descriptions.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1451-1454</sup></p>

* With practice comes the ability to find the right words to express something in the best possible way, which means in a simple, but not simplified way.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1459-1460</sup></p>

* Not only will the readers of your text appreciate your ability to explain something clearly, those you talk to will benefit from this ability as well, as it is not limited to writing. It spills over into speaking and thinking. It is proven that readers regard an author and an audience a speaker as more intelligent the more clear and to the point their expressions are (Oppenheimer 2006).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1460-1463</sup></p>

* The ability to spot patterns, to question the frames used and detect the distinctions made by others, is the precondition to thinking critically and looking behind the assertions of a text or a talk.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1463-1465</sup></p>

* Being able to re-frame questions, assertions and information is even more important than having an extensive knowledge, because without this ability, we wouldn‚Äôt be able to put our knowledge to use. The good news is that these skills can be learned. But it requires deliberate practice (Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-R√∂mer 1993; Anders Ericsson 2008).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1465-1467</sup></p>

* Permanent notes, too, are directed towards an audience ignorant of the thoughts behind the text and unaware of the original context, only equipped with a general knowledge of the field. The only difference is that the audience here consists of our future selves, which will very soon have reached the same state of ignorance as someone who never had access to what we have written about.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1473-1476</sup></p>

* Reading, especially rereading, can easily fool us into believing we understand a text. Rereading is especially dangerous because of the mere-exposure effect: The moment we become familiar with something, we start believing we also understand it. On top of that, we also tend to like it more

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1484-1486</sup></p>

* The attempt to rephrase an argument in our own words confronts us without mercy with all the gaps in our understanding. It certainly feels less good, but this struggle is the only chance we have to improve our understanding, to learn and move forward (cf. below). This, again, is deliberate practice.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1490-1492</sup></p>

* And while writing down an idea feels like a detour, extra time spent, not writing it down is the real waste of time, as it renders most of what we read as ineffectual.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1492-1494</sup></p>

* Understanding is not just a precondition to learning something. To a certain degree, learning is understanding.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1494-1495</sup></p>

* We can only improve our learning if we test ourselves on our progress

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1495-1496</sup></p>

* Learning itself requires deliberate practice, and I mean actual learning that helps us to increase our understanding of the world, not just the learning that makes us pass a test.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1511-1512</sup></p>

* Learning requires effort, because we have to think to understand and we need to actively retrieve old knowledge to convince our brains to connect it with new ideas as cues.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1517-1518</sup></p>

* ‚ÄúIf learning is your goal, cramming is an irrational act‚Äù (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1539-1540</sup></p>

* Instead of reviewing a text, you could just as well play a round of ping-pong. In fact, chances are it would help you more because exercise helps to transfer information into long-term memory (cf. Ratey 2008). Plus, exercise reduces stress, which is good, because stress floods our brains with hormones that suppress learning processes (Baram et al. 2008).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1541-1544</sup></p>

* It is not surprising, therefore, that the best-researched and most successful learning method is elaboration. It is very similar to what we do when we take smart notes and combine them with others, which is the opposite of mere re-viewing (Stein et al. 1984)

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1546-1547</sup></p>

* Even though elaboration works verifiably well for deep understanding, it might not be the best choice if you just want to learn isolated encyclopaedic facts (Rivard 1994). But as long as you are not striving for a career as a quiz show candidate, why would you want that, anyway?

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1550-1551</sup></p>

* The slip-box takes care of storing facts and information. Thinking and understanding is what it can‚Äôt take off your shoulders, which is why it makes sense to focus on this part of the work.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1551-1553</sup></p>

* Working with the slip-box, therefore, doesn‚Äôt mean storing information in there instead of in your head, i.e. not learning.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1556-1557</sup></p>

* The objection that it takes too much time to take notes and sort them into the slip-box is therefore short-sighted. Writing, taking notes and thinking about how ideas connect is exactly the kind of elaboration that is needed to learn. Not learning from what we read because we don‚Äôt take the time to elaborate on it is the real waste of time.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1558-1561</sup></p>

* There is a clear division of labour between the brain and the slip-box: The slip-box takes care of details and references and is a long-term memory resource that keeps information objectively unaltered. That allows the brain to focus on the gist, the deeper understanding and the bigger picture, and frees it up to be creative.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1561-1563</sup></p>

* Experienced academic readers usually read a text with questions in mind and try to relate it to other possible approaches, while inexperienced readers tend to adopt the question of a text and the frames of the argument and take it as a given. What good readers can do is spot the limitations of a particular approach and see what is not mentioned in the text.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1569-1572</sup></p>


* It is not surprising, therefore, that Lonka recommends what Luhmann recommends: Writing brief accounts on the main ideas of a text instead of collecting quotes. And she also stresses that it is no less important to do something with these ideas ‚Äì to think hard about how they connect with other ideas from different contexts and could inform questions that are not already the questions of the author of the respective text.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1578-1582</sup></p>

* This is exactly what we do when we take the next step, in which we write and add permanent notes to the slip-box. We don‚Äôt just play with ideas in our heads, but do something with them in a very concrete way: We think about what they mean for other lines of thoughts, then we write this explicitly on paper and connect them literally with the other notes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1582-1585</sup></p>

* More notes mean more possible connections, more ideas, more synergy between different projects and therefore a much higher degree of productivity.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1614-1615</sup></p>

* If you, by any chance, don‚Äôt have the ambition to compete with him in terms of books per year, you could settle for three notes a day and still build up a significant critical mass of ideas in a very reasonable time.

Compared to Luhmann who made six notes a day

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>note @ loc. 1618</sup></p>

* Taking literature notes is a form of deliberate practice as it gives us feedback on our understanding or lack of it, while the effort to put into our own words the gist of something is at the same time the best approach to understanding what we read.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1624-1626</sup></p>

* Taking permanent notes of our own thoughts is a form of self-testing as well: do they still make sense in writing? Are we even able to get the thought on paper?

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1626-1627</sup></p>

* Writing here, too, is not copying, but translating (from one context and from one medium into another). No written piece is ever a copy of a thought in our mind.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1628-1630</sup></p>

* We reinvent and rewrite our memory every time we try to retrieve information.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1638-1639</sup></p>

* The brain, as Kahneman writes, is ‚Äúa machine for jumping to conclusions‚Äù (Kahneman, 2013, 79). And a machine that is designed for jumping to conclusions is not the kind of machine you want to rely on when it comes to facts and rationality ‚Äì at least, you would want to counterbalance it.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1641-1643</sup></p>

* Luhmann states as clearly as possible: it is not possible to think systematically without writing (Luhmann 1992, 53).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1643-1643</sup></p>


* Almost all agree nowadays that real thinking requires some kind of externalization, especially in the form of writing. ‚ÄúNotes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible‚Äù is one of the key takeaways in a contemporary handbook of neuroscientists (Levy 2011, 290)

* ‚ÄúScarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much‚Äù (2013) by Mullainathan and Shafir. They investigate how the experience of scarcity has cognitive effects and causes changes in decision-making processes. They help the reader understand why people with almost no time or money sometimes do things that don‚Äôt seem to make any sense to outside observers.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1665-1667</sup></p>

* But the first question I asked myself when it came to writing the first permanent note for the slip-box was: What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box? This is just another way of asking: Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest?

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1674-1676</sup></p>

* As someone with a sociological perspective on political questions and an interest in the project of a theory of society, my first note reads plainly: ‚ÄúAny comprehensive analysis of social inequality must include the cognitive effects of scarcity. Cf. Mullainathan and Shafir 2013.‚Äù This immediately triggers further questions, which I can discuss on following notes, starting with: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1677-1680</sup></p>

* While I am writing these notes, it becomes obvious that the answer to the question ‚Äúwhy‚Äù has already triggered more follow-up questions, like: Isn‚Äôt this already discussed in theories of social inequality? If yes: Who discussed it? If not: Why not? And where do I turn to, to find answers to these questions? Correct: The first choice for further inquiry is the slip-box. Maybe there is already something on social inequality that helps me to answer these questions, or at least an indication of where to look.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1685-1689</sup></p>

* Transferring ideas into the external memory also allows us to forget them. And even though it sounds paradoxical, forgetting actually facilitates long-term learning.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1709-1710</sup></p>

* The reporter Solomon Shereshevsky (Lurija 1987) is one of the most famous figures in the history of psychology.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1715-1716</sup></p>

* When he confronted Shereshevsky with what seemed to him like lazy behaviour, Shereshevsky started to recount every single word that was spoken during the meeting and continued to recount verbatim all the meetings they had ever had. His colleagues were astonished, but the person most astonished was Shereshevsky himself. It was the first time he realised that everyone else seemed to have forgotten almost everything. Even those who had taken notes couldn‚Äôt remember even a fraction of what seemed normal for him.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1718-1722</sup></p>

* Aleksandr Romanovich Luria, the psychologist who subsequently tested him in all conceivable ways, couldn‚Äôt find any of the usual restrictions people normally have in their memories. But it also became clear that this advantage came at a huge cost: It wasn‚Äôt just that Shereshevsky was able to remember so much, he had trouble forgetting anything. The important things got lost under a pile of irrelevant details that involuntarily came to his mind.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1722-1725</sup></p>

* It should be obvious that for academic thinking and writing, the gift of being able to remember everything is a serious liability.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1729-1731</sup></p>

* Forgetting, then, would not be the loss of a memory, but the erection of a mental barrier between the conscious mind and our long-term memory. Psychologists call this mechanism active inhibition (cf. MacLeod, 2007). It is easy to understand what it is good for: Without a very thorough filter, our brains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible to focus on anything in our surroundings.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1735-1738</sup></p>


* Robert and Elizabeth Ligon Bjork from the University of California suggest distinguishing between two different measurements when it comes to memory: Storage strength and retrieval strength (Bjork 2011). They speculate that storage strength, the ability to store memories, only becomes greater over one‚Äôs lifetime. We add more and more information to our long-term memory.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1749-1751</sup></p>

* Learning would be not so much about saving information, like on a hard disk, but about building connections and bridges between pieces of information to circumvent the inhibition mechanism in the right moment. It is about making sure that the right ‚Äúcues‚Äù trigger the right memory, about how we can think strategically to remember the most useful information when we need it.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1754-1757</sup></p>

* If we look at the current state of education, especially the learning strategies most students employ, we see that the vast majority of all learning still aims to improve ‚Äústorage strength,‚Äù even though it cannot be improved. It is still mostly about remembering isolated facts and not so much about building connections. This is what learning psychologists have rightfully given the derogative term ‚Äúcramming:‚Äù the attempt to reinforce and solidify information in the brain by repetition.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1757-1760</sup></p>

* Using fancy words and describing it as a ‚Äústrengthening of the connections between neurons‚Äù does not change the fact that this attempt is futile.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1761-1763</sup></p>

* If we instead focus on ‚Äúretrieval strength,‚Äù we instantly start to think strategically about what kind of cues should trigger the retrieval of a memory. There are no natural cues: Every piece of information can become the trigger for another piece of information.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1763-1765</sup></p>


* These can be associations like the scent of a sweet, as the madeleine triggered childhood memories for Proust, but this kind of flashback is called ‚Äúinvoluntary memory‚Äù for a reason: we can‚Äôt retrieve it on purpose. Then there are the accidental cues that become attached to information when we learn something in a particular environment. It is, for example, easier to remember something we have learned in school if we are tested for it in the same room with the same noise in the background (Bjork 2011, 14). Likewise, sometimes it is difficult to remember something from school when we are not sitting in the classroom where we learned it.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1765-1769</sup></p>

* What does help for true, useful learning is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contexts as possible, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the slip-box with other notes. Making these connections deliberately means building up a self-supporting network of interconnected ideas and facts that work reciprocally as cues for each other.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1773-1776</sup></p>

* Mistaking learning with cramming is still very much ingrained in our educational culture.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1776-1777</sup></p>

* When Hermann Ebbinghaus, the godfather of learning theory, tried to understand the basics of learning and measuring learning progress, he deliberately used meaningless bits of information like random letter combinations and made sure they bore no accidental meaning. From his understanding, meaning would distract from the actual learning process. But he didn‚Äôt realise that he was stripping the learning process from the very thing that is learning, which is making meaningful connections.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1777-1780</sup></p>

* From the standpoint of evolution, it makes sense that our brains have a built-in preference to learn meaningful information and a disregard for meaningless letter combinations

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1780-1782</sup></p>

* The trick, of course, is not to learn like Ebbinghaus thought we would learn: by banging the information into our heads. Memory artists instead attach meaning to information and connect it to already known networks of connections in a meaningful way. One piece of information can become the cue for another and strings or networks of cues can be built. Those kinds of memory techniques are great in case you need to learn information that bears no meaning in itself or has no logical or meaningful connection to other things you already know. But why would you want to learn something like that ‚Äì except when you happen to be a memory artist?

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1787-1792</sup></p>


* When it comes to academic writing, we don't have the need for this trick, as we can choose to build and think exclusively within meaningful contexts. Abstract information like bibliographic references can be stored externally ‚Äì there is no benefit in knowing them by heart. Everything else better bear meaning.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1792-1795</sup></p>

* Memory techniques are the fix for a rather artificial situation.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1792-1792</sup></p>

* The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a piece of information so we are able to write about it. The second step is to think about what it means for other contexts as well.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1798-1799</sup></p>

* Learned right, which means understanding, which means connecting in a meaningful way to previous knowledge, information almost cannot be forgotten anymore and will be reliably retrieved if triggered by the right cues.

* provide more possible connections for new information.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1813-1814</sup></p>

* If you focus your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn. But if you focus your time and energy on learning without trying to understand, you will not only not understand, but also probably not learn. And the effects are cumulative.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1814-1816</sup></p>

* Writing notes and sorting them into the slip-box is nothing other than an attempt to understand the wider meaning of something. The slip-box forces us to ask numerous elaborating questions: What does it mean? How does it connect to ‚Ä¶ ? What is the difference between ‚Ä¶ ? What is it similar to?

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1822-1824</sup></p>

* Connections can be made between heterogeneous notes ‚Äì as long as the connection makes sense.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1824-1825</sup></p>

* This is the best antidote to the impeding way most information is given to us in our learning institutions. Most often, it comes in modular form, sorted by topic, separated by disciplines and generally isolated from other information. The slip-box is forcing us to do the exact opposite: To elaborate, to understand, to connect and therefore to learn seriously.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1825-1828</sup></p>

* The fact that too much order can impede learning has become more and more known (Carey 2014). Conversely, we know that the deliberate creation of variations and contrasts can facilitate learning.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1828-1829</sup></p>

* Nate Kornell and Bjork showed this when they experimentally taught students different art styles. First, they used the traditional approach of showing students one art style at a time using different paintings. Then, they deliberately mixed up the styles and shuffled the paintings around. The students who were presented paintings from different styles in no particular order learned to distinguish styles faster and were also much more successful at matching paintings to styles and artists they had never seen before. This shows that elaborating on the differences and similarities of notes instead of sorting them by topic not only facilitates learning, but facilitates the ability to categorise and create sensible classifications!

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1829-1835</sup></p>

* The next step after writing the permanent notes is to add them to the slip-box.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1837-1838</sup></p>

* Ideally, new notes are written with explicit reference to already existing notes. Obviously, this is not always possible, especially in the beginning when the slip-box is still in its infancy, but it will very soon become the first option most of the time.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1855-1857</sup></p>

* An initial subsequence that attracts more and more follow-up notes can easily become a main topic with many subtopics over time (Schmidt 2013, 172).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1860-1861</sup></p>

* Notes are only as valuable as the note and reference networks they are embedded in.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1868-1870</sup></p>

* We don‚Äôt need to write anything down just to bridge a gap in a note sequence.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1870-1871</sup></p>

* The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? It is a crucial difference.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1902-1905</sup></p>

* By linking two related notes regardless of where they are within the slip-box or within different contexts, surprising new lines of thought can be established.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1968-1969</sup></p>

* These note-to-note links are like the ‚Äúweak links‚Äù (Granovetter 1973) of social relationships we have with acquaintances: even though they are usually not the ones we turn to first, they often can offer new and different perspectives.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1969-1971</sup></p>

* The brain is very good at making associations and spotting patterns and similarities between seemingly different things and also very good in spotting differences between seemingly similar things, but it needs to have them presented objectively and externally. It is much easier to see differences and similarities than to detect them by mere thinking.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2002-2005</sup></p>

* The slip-box not only confronts us with dis-confirming information, but also helps with what is known as the feature-positive effect (Allison and Messick 1988; Newman, Wolff, and Hearst 1980; Sainsbury 1971). This is the phenomenon in which we tend to overstate the importance of information that is (mentally) easily available to us and tilts our thinking towards the most recently acquired facts, not necessarily the most relevant ones.

But even though flashcards are much more effective than cramming or reviewing information within the context of a textbook, they also have a downside: The information on flashcards is neither elaborated on nor embedded in some form of context. Each flashcard stays isolated instead of being connected with the network of theoretical frames, our experiences or our latticework of mental models.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2028-2031</sup></p>

* A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes. This stands in harsh contrast to the common but not-so-wise belief that we need to learn from experience. It is much better to learn from the experiences of others ‚Äì especially when this experience is reflected on and turned into versatile ‚Äúmental models‚Äù that can be used in different situations.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2050-2054</sup></p>

* When we delegate the storage of knowledge to the slip-box and at the same time focus on the principles behind an idea while we write, add and connect notes, when we look for patterns and think beyond the most obvious interpretation of a note, when we try to make sense of something, combine different ideas and develop lines of thought, we do exactly that: we build up a ‚Äúlatticework of mental models‚Äù instead of just ‚Äúremembering isolated facts and try and bang ‚Äôem back.‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2054-2058</sup></p>

* If we practice learning not as a pure accumulation of knowledge, but as an attempt to build up a latticework of theories and mental models to which information can stick, we enter a virtuous circle where learning facilitates learning.

* ‚ÄúBy learning, retaining, and building on the retained basics, we are creating a rich web of associated information. The more we know, the more information (hooks) we have to connect new information to, the easier we can form long-term memories. [‚Ä¶] Learning becomes fun.

* His recommendations for learning read almost like instructions for the slip-box: 1.¬†¬†¬† Pay attention to what you want to remember. 2.¬†¬†¬† Properly encode the information you want to keep. (This includes thinking about suitable cues.) 3.    Practice recall. (Ibid., 31)

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2070-2078</sup></p>

* We learn something not only when we connect it to prior knowledge and try to understand its broader implications (elaboration), but also when we try to retrieve it at different times (spacing) in different contexts (variation), ideally with the help of chance (contextual interference) and with a deliberate effort (retrieval).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2078-2080</sup></p>

* To be able to play with ideas, we first have to liberate them from their original context by means of abstraction and re-specification.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2129-2130</sup></p>

* Abstraction is also the key to analyse and compare concepts, to make analogies and to combine ideas; this is especially true when it comes to interdisciplinary work (Goldstone and Wilensky 2008).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2144-2145</sup></p>


* Creativity cannot be taught like a rule or approached like a plan. But we can make sure that our working environment allows us to be creative with ideas. It also helps to keep in mind some creativity-inducing ideas about problem-solving that might be counterintuitive.

* The real enemy of independent thinking is not an external authority, but our own inertia.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2152-2153</sup></p>

* The ability to generate new ideas has more to do with breaking with old habits of thinking than with coming up with as many ideas as possible. For obvious reasons, I do not recommend ‚Äúthinking outside the box‚Äù. On the contrary, we can turn the slip-box into a tool for breaking out of our own thinking habits.

* Another piece of advice is not a feature of the slip-box and might sound banal, but it is crucial: Make sure that you really see what you think you see and describe it as plainly and factually as possible.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2164-2165</sup></p>

* our perception does not follow the order of seeing first and interpreting second. It does both at the same time: We always perceive something as something ‚Äì our interpretation is instantaneous.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2167-2168</sup></p>

* If we look at a three-dimensional drawing, we cannot see it just as an arrangement of lines and shapes ‚Äì unless we are highly trained to do so. We don‚Äôt even notice objectively missing parts in our perception, like the blind spot in the middle of everything we see. We need a trick to see what we don‚Äôt see.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2169-2171</sup></p>

* The same is true when we read: We don‚Äôt see lines on a paper first, then realise that these are words, then use them to build sentences and finally decipher the meaning. We immediately read on the level of meaningful understanding. To really understand a text is therefore a constant revision of our first interpretation.

* To be able to see what we see instead of what we expect to see is indeed a skill in itself, not like a character trait of being ‚Äúopen-minded.‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2176-2177</sup></p>

* One of the most famous figures to illustrate this skill is the mathematician Abraham Wald (Mangel and Samaniego 1984). During World War II, he was asked to help the Royal Air Force find the areas on their planes that were most often hit by bullets so they could cover them with more armour. But instead of counting the bullet holes on the returned planes, he recommended armouring the spots where none of the planes had taken any hits. The RAF forgot to take into account what was not there to see: All the planes that didn‚Äôt make it back. The RAF fell for a common error in thinking called survivorship bias (Taleb 2005). The other planes didn‚Äôt make it back because they were hit where they should have had extra protection, like the fuel tank. The returning planes could only show what was less relevant.

* In his beautifully titled book ‚ÄúThe Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can‚Äôt Stand Positive Thinking,‚Äù Oliver Burkeman describes how much our culture is focused on success and how we neglect the important lessons from failure (Burkeman 2013). Manager biographies are a good example: Even though all of them contain some anecdotes about setbacks, these are always embedded in a bigger story about success (failed managers unfortunately rarely write biographies). If we try to extract a lesson from all these books, we might end up believing that persistence and charisma are paramount for success, even though these are exactly the same ingredients needed to screw a project up big time (Burkeman is referring to Jerker Denrell here).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2194-2199</sup></p>

* Another seemingly banal tip relates to a distinguishing feature of extraordinary thinkers: Taking simple ideas seriously. Consider, for example, the idea of buying stocks low and selling them high.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2208-2209</sup></p>

* The next level of understanding is reached when you realise what you buy if you buy a stock: a part of a company. Nobody would sign a contract for a house and believe it is the contract he owns now.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2212-2213</sup></p>

* This kind of self-imposed restriction is counterintuitive in a culture where more choice is usually regarded as a good thing and more tools to choose from seen as better than having less at hand. But not having to make decisions can be quite liberating.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2248-2250</sup></p>

* In his book ‚ÄúThe Paradox of Choice,‚Äù Barry Schwartz used numerous examples, from shopping to career options to romance, to show that less choice can not only increase our productivity, but also our freedom and make it easier to be in the moment and enjoy it (Schwartz, 2007). Not having to make choices can unleash a lot of potential, which would otherwise be wasted on making these choices. Academic writing should definitely be added to Schwartz‚Äô list of examples in which less choice is better.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2250-2254</sup></p>

* Thinking and creativity can flourish under restricted conditions and there are plenty of studies to back that claim

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2255-2255</sup></p>

* The biggest threat to creativity and scientific progress is therefore the opposite: a lack of structure and restrictions. Without structure, we cannot differentiate, compare or experiment with ideas. Without restrictions, we would never be forced to make the decision on what is worth pursuing and what is not.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2269-2271</sup></p>

* ‚ÄúRemember the lesson: ‚ÄòAn idea or a fact is not worth more merely because it is easily available to you.‚Äô‚Äù (Charles T. Munger

* Testing students for memorised knowledge does not give much indication about their understanding, and the fact that someone came up with a lot of ideas during a brainstorming session does not give much indication about their quality.

* the brain prioritises ideas that are easily available in the moment. This, obviously, does not equal relevant. The brain more easily remembers information that it encountered recently, which has emotions attached to it and is lively, concrete or specific.

* But finding the right topic to write about is mostly a problem for those who treated writing as a separate task from others, anyway ‚Äì not for those of us who work with the slip-box.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2312-2314</sup></p>


* Every time we read something, we make a decision on what is worth writing down and what is not.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2320-2321</sup></p>

* Every time we make a permanent note, we also made a decision about the aspects of a text we regarded as relevant for our longer-term thinking and relevant for the development of our ideas. We constantly make explicit how ideas and information connect with each other and turn them into literal connections between our notes.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2321-2323</sup></p>

* Topics grow bottom up and gain traction along the way. As soon as the slip-box has grown a bit, we can replace our thoughts on what is interesting and what we think is relevant with a pragmatic look into the slip-box, where we can plainly see what truly proved to be interesting and where we found material to work with.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2326-2329</sup></p>

* Being intimately familiar with something enables us to be playful with it, to modify it, to spot new and different ideas without running the risk of merely repeating old ideas believing they are new.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2351-2352</sup></p>

* This is why it feels in the beginning that familiarity makes it harder to come up with new ideas. We just didn‚Äôt know that most of the ideas we had are actually not that innovative. But while the belief in our own ingenuity decreases with expertise, we become more able to actually make a genuine new contribution.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2352-2355</sup></p>

* Jacob Warren Getzels and Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi showed that this is also true in art: New, groundbreaking work is rarely created on a whim by some accidental artist who believes himself to be amazingly innovative. On the contrary: The more time an artist devotes to learning about an aesthetic ‚Äúproblem,‚Äù the more unexpected and creative his solution will be regarded later by art experts (Getzels and Csikszentmihalyi 1976).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2355-2358</sup></p>


* Nothing motivates us more than seeing a project we can identify with moving forward, and nothing is more demotivating than being stuck with a project that doesn‚Äôt seem to be worth doing.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2368-2370</sup></p>

* The ability to keep control over our work and change course if necessary is made possible by the fact that the big task of ‚Äúwriting a text‚Äù is broken down into small, concrete tasks, which allows us practically to do exactly what is needed at a certain time and take the next step from there.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2383-2385</sup></p>

* The process of reading and writing inevitably produces a lot of unintended by-products. Not all ideas can fit into the same article, and only a fraction of the information we encounter is useful for one particular project.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2418-2420</sup></p>

* If we read something that is interesting, but not directly relevant to our current project, we can still use it for another project we are working on or might work on.

* overconfidence bias, admit that they too fall for it (Kahneman 2013, 245ff). The lesson to draw is to be generally sceptical about planning, especially if it is merely focused on the outcome, not on the actual work and the steps required to achieve a goal.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2457-2459</sup></p>

* Having a more realistic idea in mind not only helps them to perform better, it also boosts their motivation (Singer et al. 2001).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2462-2463</sup></p>

* But the biggest difference lies in the task you are facing to start with. It is much easier to get started if the next step is as feasible as ‚Äúwriting a note,‚Äù ‚Äúcollect what is interesting in this paper‚Äù or ‚Äúturning this series of notes into a paragraph‚Äù than if we decide to spend the next days with a vague and ill-defined task like ‚Äúkeep working on that overdue paper.‚Äù

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2485-2488</sup></p>

* The trick is not to try to break with old habits and also not to use willpower to force oneself to do something else, but to strategically build up new habits that have a chance to replace the old ones. The goal here is to get into the habit of fetching pen and paper whenever we read something, to write down the most important and interesting aspects.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2528-2531</sup></p>

* Learning, thinking and writing should not be about accumulating knowledge, but about becoming a different person with a different way of thinking. This is done by questioning one‚Äôs own thinking routines in the light of new experiences and facts.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2555-2557</sup></p>

* The more pressure we feel, the more we tend to stick to our old routines ‚Äì even when these routines caused the problems and the stress in the first place. This is known as the tunnel effect (Mullainathan and Shafir 2013). But Mullainathan and Shafir, who examined this phenomenon thoroughly, also found a way out of it: Change is possible when the solution appears to be simple.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2566-2569</sup></p>

* It is almost impossible to overstate the importance of taking care of the little things. Not only are we easily distracted by mundane thoughts, we also routinely forget small but important things when we don‚Äôt externalise them. This is why checklists are so important wherever something serious is at stake (cf. Gawande 2010).
