## 📔 Book Report
---
### 🚀 Summary
This is a book about the iGen (or Generation Z) and how they are compared to the previous generation (Millennials).

### 🥰 Who Would Like It?
Anyone who seeks to understand the iGen (Generation Z) or just curious about that said generation's behaviors will find this book enlightening.

### 🎨 Impressions
The book reads like a scientific paper so some readers may find it a little boring to read. Nevertheless, it does provide insight to the generation that we now call Generation Z (the book calls them iGen instead hence the title.)

The book refers to scientific studies that are based in America so many of the situations and advices may be US-centric.

### ☘ How the Book Changed Me
Reading this book made me realize that I fit in the generation that the book describes, so this felt like understanding a part of me that I did not know of.


### ✍️ My Top 3 Quotes
- Cultural change also has many causes, not just one—it’s not just parents, but technology, media, business, and education working together to create an entire culture that is radically different from the one our parents and grandparents experienced. It’s nobody’s fault or everybody’s fault. Cultures change, and generations change with them; that’s the important point. It’s not a contest to see which generation is worse (or better); the culture has changed, and we’re all in this together.
- Thirteen-year-olds—and even 18-year-olds—are less likely to act like adults and spend their time like adults. They are more likely, instead, to act like children—not by being immature, necessarily, but by postponing the usual activities of adults. Adolescence is now an extension of childhood rather than the beginning of adulthood.
- This is the dark side of tolerance; it begins with the good intentions of including everyone and not offending anyone but ends (at best) with a reluctance to explore deep issues and (at worst) with careers destroyed by a comment someone found offensive and the silencing of all alternative viewpoints.

* iGen is the most ethnically diverse generation in American history: one in four is Hispanic, and nearly 5% are multiracial. Non-Hispanic whites are a bare majority, at 53%.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 245-246</sup></p>

* The generation after iGen—those born in 2013 and later—will be the first majority nonwhite generation.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 248-249</sup></p>

* Cultural change also has many causes, not just one—it’s not just parents, but technology, media, business, and education working together to create an entire culture that is radically different from the one our parents and grandparents experienced. It’s nobody’s fault or everybody’s fault. Cultures change, and generations change with them; that’s the important point. It’s not a contest to see which generation is worse (or better); the culture has changed, and we’re all in this together.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 284-288</sup></p>


* iGen teens are less likely to go out without their parents. The trend began with Millennials and then accelerated at a rapid clip with iGen’ers (see Figure 1.1). The numbers are stunning: 12th graders in 2015 are going out less often than 8th graders did as recently as 2009. So 18-year-olds are now going out less often than 14-year-olds did just six years prior.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 352-355</sup></p>

* iGen teens are less likely to experience the freedom of being out of the house without their parents—those first tantalizing tastes of the independence of being an adult, those times when teens make their own decisions, good or bad.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 361-363</sup></p>

* Life history theory explicitly notes that slow or fast life strategies are not necessarily good or bad; they just are.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 421-421</sup></p>

* iGen’ers said similar things, seeing getting a license as something to be nagged into by one’s parents—a notion that would have seemed nonsensical to previous generations of teens, who were chomping at the bit to get their license.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 452-454</sup></p>

* Thirteen-year-olds—and even 18-year-olds—are less likely to act like adults and spend their time like adults. They are more likely, instead, to act like children—not by being immature, necessarily, but by postponing the usual activities of adults. Adolescence is now an extension of childhood rather than the beginning of adulthood.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 650-653</sup></p>

* If you’re not an iGen’er, think back to high school: What do you remember the most vividly? Maybe it’s the after-prom party, your first kiss, or the time you and your friends got into trouble at the mall. Chances are it’s something that happened with your friends when your parents weren’t around. Such experiences are less and less common for today’s teens. What will they remember—that funny text exchange they had with their friend? their best selfie? a meme that went viral? Or will they remember the few times they were actually with their friends in person?

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 1139-1144</sup></p>


* iGen’s was the childhood of the car seat, of being picked up at school instead of walking home by yourself, of sanitized plastic playgrounds. Boomer and GenX kids free to roam around their neighborhoods have been replaced by iGen kids supervised at every moment.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2074-2076</sup></p>

* Unfortunately, few iGen’ers seem to be aware of the long-term risks of marijuana use, which can include reduced intelligence and higher risks of schizophrenia, especially when use begins during adolescence

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2128-2129</sup></p>

* Teens just don’t want to take chances anymore—so they stay at home, drive carefully, and use only substances in amounts they think are safe—or don’t use them . . . because it’s better to be safe.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2137-2139</sup></p>


* This is the flip side of iGen’s interest in safety: the idea that one should be safe not just from car accidents and sexual assault but from people who disagree with you.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2196-2197</sup></p>

* “Safe spaces are supposed to be for people who need a place that they can express themselves without fear of being harmed verbally or physically. Safe space is not supposed to be for people who are just afraid of being offended. That type of sensitivity can hinder your ability to function in our world.”

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2212-2214</sup></p>

* the original type of safe space promoted tolerance based on someone’s identity or beliefs; the new version suggests that students should not tolerate another’s identity or beliefs.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2215-2216</sup></p>

* Piper’s example shows how far the movement toward safe spaces has gone, suggesting that ever feeling uncomfortable, for any reason, even your own failings, is something to be avoided at all costs. It’s not; that’s called learning.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2271-2273</sup></p>

* In their article “Microaggressions and Changing Moral Cultures,” the sociologists Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning argued that the United States has shifted from a culture of honor, in which people respond to a perceived slight themselves, to a culture of victimization, in which people avoid direct confrontation and instead appeal to third parties and/or public shaming to address conflict.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2296-2299</sup></p>

* Cognitive behavioral therapy, the most common and empirically supported talk therapy for depression, teaches people to try to see things more objectively. Yet the language of safe spaces, trigger warnings, and microaggressions encourages the opposite—letting your feelings guide your interpretation of reality.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2347-2350</sup></p>

* It always bothers me when Boomers and GenX’ers observe about car seats and seat belts, “We didn’t have any of that, and we survived.” Sure, you did, but those who didn’t are no longer with us to wax nostalgic about the days when they rolled around in the back of the station wagon.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2400-2402</sup></p>

* iGen’ers are not as overconfident, entitled, or grandiose as Millennials were at the same age, which in many ways is a positive development. However, some of that narcissism has been replaced with disengagement and cynicism—and that first appears in the classroom.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2465-2468</sup></p>

* iGen’ers are practical, forward looking, and safe, a far cry from the “You can be anything” and “Follow your dreams” Millennials.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2594-2595</sup></p>

* Overall, the things that many Boomers and GenX’ers enjoy the most about their jobs—interesting work, friends—are just not as important to iGen’ers. They just want the job. “We should all be less interested in jobs that are interesting or encourage creativity because they don’t pay anything. That’s why you see so many people my age 100k in debt and working at a Starbucks,” wrote Jordan, 23.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2622-2625</sup></p>

* Fewer iGen’ers said they would want to stop working if they had enough money. However, iGen’ers have continued the Millennials’ trend toward saying they don’t want to work hard. Apparently, iGen’ers know that they may have to work overtime, but they believe that many of the jobs they’d want would require too much effort. It’s just too hard to succeed today, they seem to be saying.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2653-2656</sup></p>


* iGen’ers are caught in a bind: they need to get a college education to get ahead, but they have to take out hefty student loans to pay for it. No wonder they are exhausted and just want a job—any job that can pay off their loans.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2670-2672</sup></p>

* As it turns out, iGen’ers are actually less likely to want to own their own business than Boomers and GenX’ers were at the same age, continuing a trend started by Millennials (see Figure 7.4). Just as they are cautious about driving, drinking, and dating, iGen’ers are cautious about going into business for themselves.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2683-2685</sup></p>

* iGen’ers are also less drawn to having jobs in large corporations but more interested than Millennials were in industries they might perceive as more stable, particularly the military (the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan may have something to do with that). They also express more interest in joining the police force. Even though those are potentially physically dangerous jobs, they provide a steady paycheck, with few layoffs.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2697-2700</sup></p>


* Psychologists call such beliefs external locus of control. Someone with an internal locus of control believes she is in control of her life, and someone with an external locus of control believes his life is controlled by outside forces. iGen’ers are markedly more external in their locus of control (see Figure 7.6

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2748-2751</sup></p>

* Compared to previous generations, iGen’ers also see more barriers in their way to success. More believe that their lack of ability will keep them from getting the job they want, that not knowing the right people will interfere, and that their family background will stand in the way. And, as we saw earlier, more also say that they think getting the job they want will involve too much work.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2758-2761</sup></p>


* Compared to the Millennials just before them, iGen’ers are hungry: they know they need to succeed to make it in an increasingly competitive world, but they lack the outsize bravado of the Millennials.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2796-2797</sup></p>

* iGen’ers want products that will be useful to them, make them feel unique, and provide them with the convenience or comfort they want. “I think we are just looking for a product to help us out in our daily lives,” wrote Sophia, 21. “It’s not about trying to keep up with others or fit in, we just need something that works and gets the job done.”

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2859-2862</sup></p>

* Businesses that can make the shopping experience personal and fast will be most likely to attract iGen’ers’ growing number of dollars.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2865-2866</sup></p>

* Millennials (ages 25 to 34) were most likely to agree that “I sometimes go shopping just for the fun of it”—more than iGen’ers (ages 18 to 24).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2870-2871</sup></p>

* Overall, iGen’ers are more focused on practical things, less attracted to fame, and more likely to favor logic over emotions

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 2876-2877</sup></p>

* The Pew Research Center found that 40% of Millennials and iGen’ers agreed that the government should be able to prevent people from making offensive statements about minority groups, compared to only 12% of the Silent generation, 24% of Boomers, and 27% of GenX’ers.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3571-3574</sup></p>

* This is the dark side of tolerance; it begins with the good intentions of including everyone and not offending anyone but ends (at best) with a reluctance to explore deep issues and (at worst) with careers destroyed by a comment someone found offensive and the silencing of all alternative viewpoints.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3590-3592</sup></p>

* The political scientist April Kelly-Woessner found that the rejection of free speech by social justice advocates is generationally new: social justice and free speech beliefs are unrelated among those over 40, but those under 40 who support social justice are less supportive of free speech.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3611-3613</sup></p>

* This shows the two sides of campus tolerance: on the positive side, a kind inclusiveness, but on the negative side, a quick and brutal judgment of anyone who makes a comment deemed offensive, even if it’s misinterpreted or meant as a joke.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3634-3636</sup></p>

* If that many students question the presentation of any material about racial differences, it is no wonder that many faculty are now afraid to teach any topic connected to race, effectively shutting down any discussion of ethnic and cultural differences—in theory, conversations that might lead to better understanding.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3657-3659</sup></p>

* We live in a multicultural society,

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3688-3688</sup></p>

* “When we have a poverty level of zero and a debt of zero and crime of zero, that’s when I feel like we can go out and help all the other countries out there that need our help,” he says. This is nationalism and isolationism born out of economic fears.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3817-3819</sup></p>

* iGen’ers’ interest in safety and their heightened concerns about their economic prospects have combined to make them more politically conservative than most anticipated and more open to nationalist messages.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3821-3823</sup></p>

* Liberals tend to be individualistic about equal rights issues (say, same-sex marriage) but collectivistic about social programs (government-sponsored health care). Conservatives are individualistic about social programs (thinking people should help themselves) but collectivistic about equal rights issues (thinking traditional roles often work out better).

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3933-3936</sup></p>

* iGen’ers’ and the Millennials’ attraction to socialism might be based in their youth—young people rarely earn much—or in their perception that the economic system is rigged against them

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 3978-3979</sup></p>

* Perhaps iGen’ers are so distrustful of government that they don’t see the point in being interested.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4019-4020</sup></p>

* iGen’ers are more likely to think that nothing really helps, so there’s no point in getting involved.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4047-4047</sup></p>

* Rising politicians trying to appeal to the next generation will not only have to accommodate iGen’ers’ polarized views and libertarian values, they will also have to overcome their shrinking interest in politics overall—until a politician becomes a meme.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4112-4114</sup></p>


* The human brain cannot multitask: we can focus our attention on only one cognitive task at a time. If we try to do two things that require our conscious attention at the same time, we have to switch our attention back and forth between them, which takes time and makes everything take longer.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4249-4251</sup></p>

* Young people are entering college and the working world without as much experience with adult independence.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4346-4346</sup></p>

* iGen’ers are so frightened of confrontation that they would rather tell an administrator that a fellow student said something that upset them than say a few words to that person themselves.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4399-4401</sup></p>

* Many quickly discovered that iGen’ers had no idea how to write a résumé—but were very good at making videos

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4474-4475</sup></p>

* Overall, iGen is good news for managers: iGen’ers are more focused on work and more realistic about what that entails than the Millennials just before them. iGen’ers want good, stable jobs and are eager to prove themselves. Contrary to popular belief, they don’t want to be entrepreneurs—in fact, they are less likely than previous generations to want to own their own business or be self-employed. That means iGen talent is ripe for the picking for the right businesses. iGen’ers are also less entitled and narcissistic than Millennials and have more moderate expectations.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4479-4483</sup></p>

* The downside is that more young employees are anxious and uncertain; they are eager to do a good job but are scared of making mistakes. iGen’ers are more likely to put in extra work to get a presentation finished in time but less confident that it will be successful.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4485-4486</sup></p>

* Managers who learned to be cheerleaders for Millennials will find they are more like therapists, life coaches, or parents for iGen’ers.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4488-4489</sup></p>

* iGen’ers are becoming adults at a slower pace than Millennials did and are products of colleges that are increasingly focused on safety and protection. Do not be shocked when your young employees consult their parents when they need advice or when they seem more like 18-year-olds than 22-year-olds.

<p style="text-align: right;"><sup>highlight @ loc. 4507-4509</sup></p>
