title: Learning facilitates learning

---


When we learn something, we connect it to prior information and try to understand it (elaboration).

We also retrieve it at different times (spacing) in different contexts (variation), sometimes randomly and with a deliberate effort (retrieval)

When we know more and [[Connect two notes to gain insight|connect relevant info together]], the easier it is to form long-term memories.
