title: Finding something interesting isn’t the same as knowing something and being able to work with it

Copying and researching stuff is addictive. It gives us an impression that we are making progress. 

Collecting does not equal to learning. This is called the **Collector's Fallacy**.

Umberto Eco gives advice:
> _…as soon as you have the photocopy, read it and annotate it immediately. If you are not in a great hurry, do not photocopy something new before you own (that is, before you have read and annotated) the previous set of photocopies.”_
