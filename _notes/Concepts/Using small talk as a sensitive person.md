title: Using small talk as a sensitive person
---

People use small talk as a way of relaxant when a relationship is new.

Sensitive people do the reverse. They only enjoy small talk with people who are close to them.

When sensitive people are in an environment that allows them to "nurture their authenticity" or be themselves then they are pretty much just like everyone else.
