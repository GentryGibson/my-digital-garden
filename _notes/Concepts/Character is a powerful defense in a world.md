title: Character is a powerful defense in a world that would love to be able to seduce you, buy you, tempt you, and change you

Building and growing your character prevents you from getting swindled by those with ill-intentions.

If a healthy lifestyle prevents you from getting illnesses, then building character is the mental equivalent.

Full quote:
 > _Character is a powerful defense in a world that would love to be able to seduce you, buy you, tempt you, and change you. If you know what you believe and why you believe it, you’ll avoid poisonous relationships, toxic jobs, fair-weather friends, and any number of ills that afflict people who haven’t thought through their deepest concerns. That’s your education. That’s why you do this work._
