title: Solitude allows you to activate Deliberate Practice mode

When you're alone, you can do things in Deliberate Practice mode. This "mode" allows you to focus and is the key to exceptional achievement.

Teenagers dread being alone and because of this, they fail to cultivate their talents.

Things such as practicing music or studying requires solitude. Participating in a online working group is also a form of solitude on its own.
