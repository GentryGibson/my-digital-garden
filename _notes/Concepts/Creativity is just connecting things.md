title: Creativity  is just connecting things

---


This is a quote from Steve Jobs:
>_Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something_

This quote goes against the idea that [[Great ideas do not come in a flash|great ideas come in a flash]].
