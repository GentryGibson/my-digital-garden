title: Double standards of individuality
---

We like individuality but not the kind that makes us look like loners or "anti-socials". Instead, society prefers the type that "puts oneself out there".

Because of this, introversion (along with shyness, seriousness, and sensitivity) has been sometimes seen as a pathology or things that you have to overcome or fix.

The idea of this double standards reminds me of this meme:
	- Society: Be yourself.
	- Also society: No. Not like that.
