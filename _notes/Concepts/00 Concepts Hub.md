Here you can find a list of interesting concepts gathered from reading stuff.

## How Do Concepts Work?
---
1.  If you see a word that seems hard to understand or interesting, make a note in here.
2.  Explain the concept in your own words. Make fun analogies if necessary.
3.  On the Related subheader, add anything that helps you remember the concept ("this reminds me of a SpongeBob episode when...") and add where you first found it.
