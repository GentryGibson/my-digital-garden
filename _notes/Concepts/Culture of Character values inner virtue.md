title: Culture of Character values inner virtue
---

A Culture of Character values inner strength, integrity, modesty, and the good deeds that you do when no one is looking.

It is how we behave in private that matters. First impressions did not count.

The demands of this culture can be seen in <i> Little Women </i>:
><i>"Learn to know and value the praise which is worth having, and to excite the admiration of excellent people by being modest as well as pretty."</i>
