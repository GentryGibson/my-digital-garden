title: Being familiar with something lets you spot and generate new ideas

In the context of illustrations, you can derive (and mix and match) art styles that you are familiar with and create something new.

Example: Hirohiko Araki is influenced by the works of Paul Gauguin, fashion, heavy metal, horror films and Michelangelo's sculptures. These inspirations can be seen in his work, _Jojo's Bizarre Adventure_.
