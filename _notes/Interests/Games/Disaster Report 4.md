## Short Review
Somewhat clunky game with an interesting premise: you have to escape a city destroyed by a major earthquake.

### Similar Games
- SOS: An older game for the SNES. This time, you have to escape a capsized ship within an hour (in real-time!). The closest video-game adaptation to <i>The Poseidon Adventure</i>. Has a Japanese only sequel called <i>Septentrion: Out of the Blue</i>.
