title: Reading and Highlighting - A Case Study
---

## Summary
---

### Goal
- Find a way to compile highlighted notes from Kindle and from other sources (physical books, journal articles, etc.).

### Things I Learned
- Highlighting is just one part of the reading process. Linking those highlights and paraphrasing them in your own words maximizes the thought process involved.
- Using Zotero lets me read my art and programming books on my iPad without using iTunes.
- I can use these for other sources of information (books, academic journals, and videos).

## Timeline
---
### Defining the Problem
- Find a way to find a link and structure to the notes from Google Keep.
- Compile all the highlights found in ebooks and PDFs.

### Finding Solutions
- Based on experience, highlighting on Kindle does the job but going over them again is tedious.
- Found Readwise but it's a subscription based app so no.
- Found Kindle Mate which can extract notes from the books, even deleted books. 
	- Downside: It extracts all notes even the ones that were erased.
- Found Highlighted and Highlight apps and compared the two. Settled with Highlighted as it does what I need to do.
- Found Zotero and utilized the iPad Workflow to be able to read, highlight, and annotate journal articles, textbooks, and art books.
	- This replaces my previous iPad workflow: open iTunes on a laptop and syncing the iPad.

### Creating the Workflow
- **Step 1:** Read the book, highlight some notes. Use Kindle for ePUBS, iPad for PDFs.
- **Step 2:** Use Highlighted app from iPad to get the highlights from ebooks and physical books.
	- Use Zotero from desktop to get the highlights from journal articles and textbooks in .PDF.
- **Step 3:** Import all highlights to Obsidian
	- Kindle: Use Highlighted app and extract it as Markdown. Send file to Google Drive
	- Zotero: Right-click PDF -> Manage Attachments -> Extract Annotations

- **Step 4:** Paraphrase the highlighted notes
	- Most tedious part as it maximizes thought process but worth the time.
	- Add highlights and paraphrased parts (book report) under Books Hub.
	- Add journal articles (the one from Zotero) under Academic Journals Hub.
	- Add web articles and videos under Interesting Stuff.
- **Optional:** Sync Zotero PDFs on iPad
