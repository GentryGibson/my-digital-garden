title: Reading and Highlighting 2 - A Case Study
---

## Summary
---
### Goal
- Find a way to automate the [[Case Study Reading and Highlighting|previous workflow]] as it is tedious when there are too many highlights in one book.

### Things I Learned
- Let machines automate the tedious processes.
- Automating the extraction of highlights gives me more time to actually read the books and paraphrase the extracted highlights


## Timeline
---
### Defining the Problem
- Find a way to automate the extraction of highlights from Kindle.
- The Highlighted app works but sometimes picks up wrong text and seems more receptive with physical books.

### Finding Solutions
- Found [[How to Use Fyodor|Fyodor]] and tested it out if it works.
	- The program is not perfect. It still detects all erased and wrong highlights


### Creating the Workflow
- **Step 1:** Read the book and highlight some notes.
- **Step 2:** Get ```My Clippings.txt``` from Kindle
- **Step 3:** Run Fyodor to extract the text file
- **Step 4:** Add the Markdown files to Obsidian
