title: Book Blog or Digital Garden?
---

These are some notes I took when deciding on a blog or a digital garden. The result is this website!


## Why Make a Book Blog?
---

- Sharing and showing my work.
- Practice writing and learning in public.

## Blog or Digital Garden?
---

- **Blog:** There is a need to structure stuff based on keywords, titles, and metadata.
- **Digital Garden:** This is like a “hole in the wall” restaurant in a corner but with your thoughts in the internet instead.
	- This is like a continuation of the "old web" where the website is for your own personal use and people can come and visit.
-  Blogs have to be perfect but digital gardens are ever changing



## Basic Content
---
- Book Reviews
- Notes about my interests (i.e. music, drawing, history)
