title: My Failed Journey to Create a Personal Website
---


## Summary
---
### Retrospective
- Reading this case study again made me wonder if I have troubling focusing as I jump from one task or video to another.
- I also realized that making a professional personal website is not my thing after all.
	- Based on the design, some of it broke the rules or the correct way of making  a website. 
		- I was trying to blend it with how early websites used to look like but with the accessibility of new ones.
	- This lead me to break away from finishing this project and creating a digital garden instead.
- I have set myself a high goal (create a fully functional website from scratch designed and coded by me) and that lead me feeling discouraged when making this website.
	- **Lesson learned:** Start small and keep things simple. The digital garden is pretty much me following this step.


### Things I Learned
- Getting stuck is part of the process.

### Goal
- Create a fully functional website from scratch designed and coded by me.


## Timeline
---

### Back to School: Typography 101

-   Watched Typography That Works: Typographic Composition and Fonts from Skillshare to learn how grids and how different types work.
    - Even if this course applies to Graphic Design, a lot of the rules in creating a business card as shown on that video still applies when it comes to creating a website.

### Drawing Board: The Mockup

- Sketched the website on a small notepad. What I thought at first was just making thumbnails but apparently, this is called "Website wireframing". Sketches are found in the 'Forget-Me-Not Ideas Journal'
- Created a mockup in Photoshop and then realized midway that making one in that program is the old school way to go. I stopped and did research as to what people are now using for making websites.

### Research: Finding the Appropriate App

- Found three apps: Adobe XD, Figma, and Sketch.
    - Sketch is only for Mac so not an option.
    - Figma is free and browser-based but can only make 3 projects. I'll need to pay for subscription for more than 3 projects.
    - Adobe XD is subscription based so no.
    - Settled with Figma since I'll just be using it for personal projects.
- Will have to learn how to use Figma and replicate the unfinished mockup from Photoshop.

### Back to School: How to Figma and User Experience (UX)

- I watched Design A Website In Under 1 Hour With Figma and half of Figma Tutorial - A Free UI Design/Prototyping Tool. It's awesome. on YouTube
- Watching the two Figma tutorials don't really help me learn the theoretical side or the rules when making a website. So I supplemented these by watching The 2019 UI Design Crash Course for Beginners on YouTube and Intro to UX: Fundamentals of Usability on Skillshare.

### Drawing Board: Figma Time

- Changed a bit of the 'What I Do' part so it doesn't feel repetitive looking.
- Used just the serif type for headlines only. I thought it was a good idea to make everything serif but it doesn't look good. My choice of making them all serif type is due to ignorance on my part.
- I got stuck during the designing process due to ignorance yet again so I went back to school.

### Back to School: Welcome to the World of Programming

-   I learned that Figma has a user's manual found in the Drafts. Very helpful in case I forget something. Reading the documentation is important.
-   Got overwhelmed and ended up getting sidetracked by researching more and more about programming as a whole.
-   Watched a bunch of programming related videos to give myself an idea of how it works:
    -   [Top Tools For Web Developers That I Use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9VZEgbHxrg)
    -   [Guide to Becoming a Self-Taught Software Developer](https://www.notion.so/Guide-to-Becoming-a-Self-Taught-Software-Developer-cedc439715ab4779a3bf954f4de26a62)
    -   [Learn Programming FAST! My Favorite Method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj3QejzYZ70&t=1s)
    -   [Becoming a Frontend Developer / Designer in 2019 - Five Step Guide](https://www.notion.so/Becoming-a-Frontend-Developer-Designer-in-2019-Five-Step-Guide-6164bbceedca48f59d5a7e707b65840a)
-   Found two bootcamp style websites for programming: [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
-   Took the short quiz in Codeacademy which led to an epiphany moment. I was more of a [problem solver](https://www.codecademy.com/explore/sorting-quiz/results?advocator=26&connector=35&questioner=30&solver=36)rather than a user advocate (aka designer).
-   Based on what I've learned in [[Guide to Becoming a Self-Taught Software Developer]], I created a curriculum of what I wanted to learn. In this case, it's Web Design and Web Development.
    -   I'll also use the curriculum style for other skills like video editing, motion graphics, etc.
-   During this Back to School session, I realized that I am working my way to be a self-taught web designer / developer.
    -   Because of this, I started watching YouTube videos about self-taught programmers:
        -   [[Teaching yourself to learn programming Start Here|Teaching yourself to learn programming? Start Here!]]
        -  [[One Thing to Learn to Become a Self-Taught Programmer|#1 Thing to Learn to Become a Self-Taught Programmer]]
    -   And also because of this, I got sidetracked again and found the r/learnprogramming subreddit which is a gold mine of resources. I also became interested in learning Python.
-   During my research on web development, I came across the Zero to Mastery article called **Learn to code in 2020, get hired, and have fun along the way**. It is basically a walkthrough on learning how to code as divided by month. It's like I really am back to school again.
    -   With this revelation, I realized there are a lot of things I still don't know about this industry as a whole. It is like walking in unknown territory.
-   After watching **Design A Website In Under 1 Hour With Figma**, I finalized the learning plan for Web Design and started watching **Web Design for Web Developers: Build Beautiful Websites!**
-   While reading up on prototyping for Figma, I found out that the app doesn't have a native anchor link support. You can fake it by duplicating the entire page (where you want to use anchor links) and link the sections one by one.
-   I learned that the **Complete Web & Mobile in 2021: UI/UX, Figma + more** is on Udemy so I planned to watch that after **Intro to UX: Fundamentals of Usability**.
